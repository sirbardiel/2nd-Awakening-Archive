Rather, this sense manifests as a powerful awareness of the pressing \"wrongness\" of the Abyss as the willworker closes on it (or, conversely, as it closes on the willworker). After casting this spell, the mage becomes attuned to the alien emanations of the Abyss, detecting them through feelings and images of fear, pain, horror, and otherwise skewed awareness of the world around him. Ordinary scenes and occurrences take on a malevolent cast, as inhuman whispers circulate through the crowd at a train station, deformed faces leer from shadowed corners (and vanish the instant the character looks back), moans of suffering and ecstasy well up from manhole covers, and other images of the gruesome and nightmarish transpire just at the edge of perception. Characters unprepared for the experience (think of the title character's glimpses of the bizarre and the terrifying in the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder for an idea of just how this sense manifests) are likely to develop 1 or more derangements. Even when Abyssal phenomena are not at hand, light seems a little cold and thin through the lens of this magic; everything looks a little more rundown, the eyes of living things are flat and unreflective, wind seems a bit too still, while normal noises sound muffled and whispers are a bit too loud. Any mage who uses this spell on too regular a basis will almost certainly find that all sense of reality begins to wear thin, as an expectation of Abyssal intrusion takes hold of her. Eventually, she might become afraid not to have this magic active -- who knows when the Abyss will come calling, after all?",

An ability that most crime-scene investigators would give their eye-teeth for, this spell enables a mage to discern at a glance exactly how a creature died and how long ago. Thus, the mage might be able to realize that a cause of death obvious to all modern forensic evidence is in fact a ruse designed to distract from the subject's true cause of death. Because of the limitations of the Death Arcanum, Forensic Gaze reveals only cause of death and not mitigating circumstances. If used upon a human skeleton, for example, it can reveal that the individual died as a result of damage to the carotid artery two months ago to the day, but does not tell the mage that the victim also had a lethal dose of strychnine in his system at the time of his demise. This limitation on the sense can come in quite handy, however (such as finding a mutilated body and learning that it was a deliberate stab to the heart, rather than the obvious manic rending of flesh, that resulted in the person's death). Even if physical evidence of the cause of death is absent (as with a body reduced to ash), this spell reveals what killed the being in question and how much time has passed since it died. The mage peers at a corpse to ascertain the cause of death. He does not need to touch, prod, or cut into the corpse; he merely stares at it. Fairly obvious causes such as a knife wound or heart attack levy no penalties, but obscure causes such as a rare neuro-toxin might cause a -2 or greater penalty. Likewise, deaths that took place more than a year ago suffer -1 dice. Deaths older than a decade suffer an additional -1 dice per decade. It is possible to detect a vampire with this spell, although the cause of death (the Embrace) is extremely obscure (-3 penalty). The caster also suffers the usual penalty of -1 die per decade that the vampire has been dead. Zombies, too, can be detected, although their state is usually obvious even to those without this spell.",

Mages use this spell to hide themselves from easy scrutiny, literally hiding in shadows, and even sculpting shadows to best cover themselves or an awkwardly shaped object that otherwise might jut out into the light under natural conditions. A simple success allows a mage to shape a one-yard radius area of shadows or darkness into shapes of his choosing, or he can thicken its gloom, making shadows deeper even under bright light. The Storyteller assesses the quality of existing shadows, categorizing them into three degrees: From light to dark to complete darkness. Each success deepens the darkness by one degree. Once complete darkness is achieved, additional successes impose dice penalties to perception rolls on a one-for-one basis for anyone peering into the area.

This does not remove the soul, or it physically harm the Sleeper, but the lack of alignment does make him more susceptible to soul-affecting magic in the future. The mage, for her part, can use this spell as a weapon or a threat, but it is more commonly used by the Echo Walkers to gain information about the Ones Before. The mage must touch the target to enact this spell (at Death 3, she can cast this spell at sensory range). The target feels a sudden chill and then a profound feeling of distance and isolation, as though he were miles away from everything in his vicinity. The mage, through the use of the Prime Arcanum, can see \"behind\" the soul, viewing the Sleeper on a spiritual level so primitive that no part of his individual ego is present. Most mages find the experience profoundly disturbing, because a human being stripped of his individual humanity is simply a great deal of instinct and a little bit of intellect. Thus, it is possible to cast this spell using only the Death Arcanum, which knocks the soul out of joint but does not convey any mystical insight. This glimpse behind the soul lasts only a turn, after which the mage loses focus on the soul and must cast this spell on a different Sleeper in order to see this \"proto-soul.\" While the mage peers through the gap, the player can make a Gnosis roll. If the roll is successful, the mage regains a spent Willpower point. Doing so too often, however, can have a serious drawback -- the mage becomes addicted to what she sees through the gap, and for every week that passes in which she does not successfully use this spell to get a glimpse, she suffers a cumulative -1 dice penalty on all Social- and Mental-related rolls. When this addiction sets in is up to the Storyteller; one possibility is that it occurs as soon as the mage loses a dot of Wisdom from casting this spell. It is safe to assume that most, if not all, Echo Walkers suffer from this addiction. The effects on the Sleeper target are long-lasting and brutal. The target becomes depressed, irritable, and unable to relate to others as well as he once could. All Social rolls suffer a -1 dice penalty until the Sleeper can realign his soul. Doing this requires the target to reaffirm his connection to the rest of humanity, meaning that some people can correct the damage within a few hours (a loving father, for example, might find that spending an afternoon caring for his children does the trick, while an ER doctor might save someone's life and repair the damage). Other people can help the person realign his soul -- therapy, spiritual counseling, or simply positive attention can shift the victim's soul back into place (this might require a roll of, for instance, Manipulation + Empathy for counseling or Intelligence + Medicine for psychiatric help, though it's worth noting that pharmaceutical remedies don't help matters). People who lack the tools to fix the damage themselves, however, often make it worse. Any degeneration rolls made for the victim while the soul is dislodged automatically fail, and any derangements gained are considered severe. The victim often becomes suicidal (or, occasionally, violent) within a week or two. A person afflicted by this spell can be detected by the Death 1 Soul Marks spell. Any spell that affects the human soul receives a +2 dice bonus when cast upon a Sleeper suffering the effects of Dislodge Soul. The Spirit 3 Restore Lost Soul spell can also correct the damage that Dislodge Soul causes. Doing so requires the restoring mage to accumulate a number of successes equal to the Potency of the Dislodge Soul spell. Casting this spell upon a Sleeper requires a degeneration roll for mages of Wisdom 2 or more. This spell cannot be cast upon Awakened targets, although a Death 4 version of this spell can target mages.",

The mage could use it as a mirror to allow anyone (even Sleepers) to see ghosts or objects that are present in Twilight. Most often, it is used to allow a Twilight ghost to manifest without suffering any dice modifiers for location or the presence of mortals. The ectoplasm takes the shape of the ghost's own image. Successes are allocated between the ectoplasm's Size (base 5 or less, plus one per allocated success) and its solidity. Its base solidity is like a spider web's, but allocated successes can make this denser and thicker, giving the ectoplasm some weight and increasing detail. A ghost that manifests through ectoplasm with one success of solidity has only vague features. With two successes, its face can be recognized by those who knew it in life. Five successes make it look almost real (except for its uniform white color). Even with five successes (the maximum solidity), a material being or object can pass through the ectoplasm with little resistance. A manifesting ghost is not affected by damage to its ectoplasmic \"body\"; it merely becomes harder to make out its features. The ectoplasm remains for one hour or for the rest of the scene.",

She could, for example, pull a ghostly hammer out of a Twilight room in order to pound a nail into a wall. She could take the spectral reflection of a key out of the lock in which it was broken, pull it through into materiality, and use it to open the material lock barring her from entering a room she wishes to access. She can also touch ghosts and be touched (or attacked) in return by any nearby shade. Such beings tend to be, at best, cold and clammy and many have other disturbing and not entirely tactile sensations associated with physical contact. Some spectres have been known to long for physical contact with the living in ways most unhealthy or inappropriate. The caster cannot damage ghosts, or affect non-dead spirits such as fetches or mental projections, including vampires using the Twilight Projection Discipline (she needs the Spirit and Mind Arcana, respectively, for those effects). Objects drawn from Twilight possess Durability 1 and crumble into a fine ash if broken, regardless of their original consistency. Nothing really makes these items superior to (or even the equal of) those a mage could acquire normally in the material world, but being able to snatch the revolver from the nearby ghost of a police officer when the mage is attacked can be a lifesaver. Note that objects found in Twilight are only infrequently the same as those found in the material world, as only lost or broken objects tend to manifest in that state.

A mage can restore her resolve or \"burn out\" a living human Pattern for its Mana, drawing this energy directly into her own stores to use as she will. The spell does not work if cast upon an animal; if it is, nothing happens. If used on a vampire or other form of walking dead, the spell provides no benefit to the mage. In general, the spell is meant for use upon a normal human being, and any attempt to diverge from that procedure is not apt to go well for the caster. The mage must first grab hold of the target, with a Strength + Brawl roll, subtracting the target's Defense. If successful, he can cast this spell as an instant action in the following turn. (With Death 4, he can cast this spell at sensory range as an instant action. He needs Death 5 before he can add Space 2 for a sympathetic casting.) Each success allows the mage to replenish one of his spent Willpower points by harvesting it from a person who has suffered at least one aggravated wound during the current scene (including one who has lost all of his Health to lethal damage and now suffers aggravated damage as his body dies), up to a maximum of the victim's remaining Willpower points. Alternatively, the mage may burn out a person's Pattern for points of Mana, converting the ephemeral energies that make up his idealized form into raw power. Each success inflicts one lethal Health wound onto the victim and gives the caster one Mana point. If the victim is a mage, his own Mana points are unaffected; this spell steals energy directly from his Pattern. The caster must use the Prime 5 Siphon Mana spell to directly tap an Awakened person's Mana. Direct siphoning requires a separate casting from the Willpower-harvesting version of this spell, although both effects can be combined using the normal rules for combining spells. Devouring the Slain can be used only on a given individual once, after which a new level of aggravated damage must be inflicted upon him before he can again be a target.",

Successfully casting this spell, which may be used only by a mage who is unconscious due to damage (with all his Health boxes filled with lethal damage, and who has \"rolled over\" into at least one box of aggravated damage) -- an exception to the normal rules for spellcasting -- destroys the casting willworker's body, killing him instantly and irrevocably.

A \"deliberate\" action is one into which the character must put conscious effort. Attacking an enemy, searching for an exit, and driving a car are all deliberate actions, but a reflexive roll to resist another power is not. Perception rolls are not necessarily deliberate, but noticing one's surroundings does require a degree of involvement with them, and so such rolls receive a negative modifier equal to the mage's Expression rating. Obviously, characters who cannot hear are exempt from the effects of this spell. Also, the caster has no ability to choose targets -- it affects everyone within earshot. He can warn any allies in the area, of course, enabling them to prepare themselves (casting a Mental Shield, using earplugs, spending Willpower on the resistance roll), but beyond that, the song saddens everyone who hears it.

Where, then, does an enterprising necromancer turn for assistance? Quicken Corpse animates one or more corpses to serve as unfailing, devoted slaves. What such servants lack in wits and motivation, they more than make up for in dogged determination and sheer, tireless pursuit of the tasks they are set. Generally speaking, such ambulatory corpses possess a level of reasoning just above that of a rather intelligent dog. They understand certain visual cues (such as the opening of the door they are meant to guard) and auditory commands (\"Defend me!\"), but cannot perform feats requiring abstract intellect. They have a limited memory, but cannot make even basic correlations or inferences. (While they can, for example, dimly recall that their master has changed their clothes once a day, they cannot determine that he is likely to do so again tomorrow.) They have no individual initiative. These corpse-slaves are not really any stronger than they were in life, but they are tireless and completely without the ability to sense or respond to pain. They need not eat or sleep and do whatever chore they are set to until told otherwise, even if it requires them to tear their own bodies apart in the attempt. They experience neither fear nor the desire for self-preservation and have no minds, per se, for others to control. They can, however, be wrested away from their master through the casting of this spell by another necromancer. Only one success is required to animate a corpse. Additional successes determine the strength of the mage's control. Someone attempting to wrest control of the walking dead with another casting of this spell must exceed the original caster's successes.

When reduced below this level and presented with any source of dead flesh, the zombie will feed, consuming one level of the corpse's Size over the course of five turns and regaining one health box, until such time as the zombie is restored to at least the appropriate level of health programmed into the zombie by the caster. Note that the zombie can only be magically compelled to seek out alternate sources of sustenance by an effect that exceeds the Potency of this spell, though the zombie will break off from feeding to defend itself from harm.",

The mind and spirit are absent. The mage determines a trigger that will wake him from this state (such as being struck or having a dog bark within earshot).

So great was the soldier's devotion to his people, however, that even his death could not prevent him from saving lives, until at last, Khadarmas, too, was swallowed by the waves, bidden a tearful farewell by those he had given his life to rescue from Atlantis' doom.

The character is effectively invisible in areas of either normal or supernatural darkness and can see perfectly well in either, though he is not blinded or in any way discomfited by sunlight (save for the possibility of Disbelief on the part of Sleepers who witness a disembodied shadow moving under its own power and quite possibly against the direction of the light.) The mage's Attributes and other characteristics remain the same, though he cannot make any physical attacks (any that require touch with a hand, a weapon, or a unit of ammunition) while in this form, but may, himself, be attacked normally. The caster may alter his Size when casting this spell, as per the systems given under the Life 4 Shapechanging spell for doing so. By adding Matter 4 to the casting, the mage can cause all of his normal equipment (such as clothing, a cellular phone or a handgun) to change into shadow with him, though they retain no distinct properties; the phone neither makes nor receives calls and the gun cannot be used to fire bullets, for example.",

As one of the walking dead, his actions depend on inflexible passions instead of genuine human feelings. This spell is a prepared version of the \"Revenant\" spell. The mage must cast the spell ahead of time. Once cast, the spell can be activated with an instant action. At that point, the spell kills the mage instantly (using a voluntarily permanent version of Suppress Own Life that painlessly causes physical and spiritual death) and turns him into a revenant. Determine the revenant's Passions and other traits at the time of casting, not activation. This spell doesn't work if the mage isn't willing to die; the component that slays the mage isn't strong enough to overcome the psychic resistance he might muster by having second thoughts (though a Death 5 variant allows this). The character suffers real (and barring the intervention of an archmaster) irrevocable death. The spell is essentially a form of suicide, used when a mage is cornered, wounded, and will not prevail in his current state. Storytellers and players should ensure that the character really is ready to die. If there's any question about this, a Resolve + Composure roll might help determine whether his will could really trump his survival instincts. Alternately, he might have to fail a Wisdom check.",

Erik based his spell on the philosophies of Hagakure, a Japanese text that extols the virtues of suicide for one's lord. He believes that he's serving Sleepers as a whole and should be ready to lay down his life at any time, so he casts this spell periodically so that, in the event of being critically wounded or trapped, he can die and will his remains to continue.

But the mage cannot cheat death without giving something in return -- himself. With this spell, the mage gives up his own life, and dies so that another might live, and more than this, so that the other might Awaken. Although the casting of the spell is described here as \"instant,\" the time it takes a mage to prepare to cast the spell can be lengthy, as the caster will sometimes set up an appointment with the Reaper -- perhaps creating the circumstances that will allow a crazed enemy to take one final, fatal shot, perhaps subconsciously exposing himself to a disease or a poison. The corpse of the person whom the mage wants to raise must be intact, meaning that the body can't have begun to decay. Also, the subject cannot have died of old age -- the subject must have had an untimely death, from disease, violence, or an accident. If the spell succeeds, the subject returns to life with all her Health dots, Attributes, Skills, and Advantages intact. The mage who cast the spell dies. How he dies depends upon the circumstances he has created. In effect, fate takes a hand in his demise. A sniper's bullet finds his temple at the moment the other arises. A terrible car accident claims his life, seconds after the spell is complete. His heart gives way to a congenital defect and he collapses, as the subject of the spell opens her eyes. The price of this spell cannot be avoided. The Reaper can't be tricked. It's a life for a life; that's the deal. The soul of the Tamer of the Cave who cast this spell vanishes. The soul cannot be retrieved, and the Saint cannot be revived by any means. The subject of the spell, meanwhile, Awakens. She doesn't awaken immediately. It could be days, weeks, months or years down the line. But she does Awaken. It could be that this is where the mage's soul goes: it enters the body of the person the mage wanted to raise, joining with her and making her a mage.

In ghostly form, the mage cannot travel to other parts of the Realms Invisible without finding some special path or conduit. The subject of the spell uses his normal traits, but cannot make use of equipment. While the mage journeys in ghostly form, his body appears to be dead; his life signs and aura are absent. Unlike many spells of this type, the mage's soul is truly absent from his body. Thus, the subject of the spell should ensure that his body is protected against possession and other forms of tampering. Life magic prevents the body from decaying or suffering similar ill effects (such as damage due to oxygen starvation) throughout the spell's duration. If the mage's body is killed, he almost always becomes a ghost, but remains in the Underworld instead of moving into Twilight near an anchor. Mages normally use this spell to uncover the secrets of the dead. Unfortunately, some force (perhaps just the trauma of the magic, but inherent to the laws of death) distorts the mage's perceptions, so that separating the reality of ghostly experiences from metaphors and visions becomes difficult. Ultimately, the Storyteller decides which parts of the mage's journey were literal experiences and which parts were visions, but all parts normally have symbolic significance. They may represent the distorted forms of strange entities the mage encountered, waypoints that no human eye can truly describe, or prophecies gleaned from the ravings of the ancient dead. For example, mages have boasted of finding Atlantis within the Underworld, but this could be anything from a genuine echo of the Awakened City to a personal vision. Nevertheless, the ghosts and writings the mage encounters there may well pass on genuine knowledge. Alternately, the traveler might encounter a dead lover who knows an obscure spell, even though he was a Sleeper throughout his life.",

Its Physical Attributes and Skills are as determined by the Construct Homunculus Form spell. The homunculus gains Intelligence and Presence dots equal to the ghost or spirit's Power dots, Wits and Manipulation equal to its Finesse dots and Resolve and Composure equal to its Resistance dots. The homunculus gains whatever Mental and Social Skills the Storyteller feels are appropriate for the type of spirit or ghost (if any), along with any Flaws and/or derangements. Any supernatural powers arising from their status as discarnate entities are unavailable to them while in homunculus form. While some ghosts and spirits crave the ability to operate in the Material Realm conveyed by possession of a homunculus form, they generally feel this way because they want to pursue a specific agenda of some kind. Savvy mages should expect the average ghost or spirit to display only minimal loyalty and cooperation, except where their own interests converge with those of the discarnate entities they've gifted with physical forms. The most loyal homunculi created in this manner are generally the ghosts of slain cabal members, who use their flawed new forms to further the collective goals they fought for while alive. The Death version of this spell targets ghosts, while its Spirit equivalent works on spirits. This spell is treated as a finishing spell. Any of the substitute relinquishment costs for Enchanted Items may be applied to it. Similar to a finishing spell, Secret Marriage can't be dispelled, only temporarily suppressed. While suppressed, the entity remains within the homunculus but is unable to animate it in any way, including the use of speech. If this spell is cast with a limited Duration, the ghost or spirit departs the homunculus body when the spell expires. The empty, inanimate homunculus may be reused, housing either the same ghost or spirit or a new volunteer.",

In a matter of nights, the seemingly tireless Acallar devised this spell, using it to seek out agents within Twilight, Shadow, and the Underworld. Having located those able -- if not necessarily willing -- to assist him, the Guardian quickly set about summoning the various otherworldly beings to his cause.

A simple success results in small turns of immediate or nearly immediate good fortune pertinent to the willworker's current circumstances (such as which vending machine will drop that dangling candy bar the last guy paid for and gave up on after it got stuck on the rotating coil). An exceptional success yields the high end of small good fortune.

It can even apply to penalties for aiming at specific targets, such as an enemy's hand or the object he holds.

In other words, while \"the sky is clear today\" could very well be a correct assessment, it is not usually a significant enough truism to register to this application of Fate. Instead, a child's assertion that a beautiful woman \"looks like an angel\" may well resound in the mage's ears if there is something truly exceptional or even supernatural about her, or if she is particularly holy or touched by the divine in some meaningful way.

		"Effect" : "The mage gains cryptic guidance from meaningful exercises of apparently random chance. Best used when the willworker has reached some sort of impasse or has no idea what to do next, Synchronicity requires the user to open herself up to some sort of random input, allowing the forces of apparent coincidence to point a way forward. The user might turn on a television and flip quickly through the channels, let an encyclopedia fall open to a random page or toss a dart at a map. Other willworkers will stake out a spot on a busy sidewalk or get in a car and follow an arbitrarily chosen vehicle. More homebound types might allow a random MP3 to play on their portable music devices or use a randomizing program to call up a serendipitous web page. Whether a television program, snippet of song lyric, address or street encounter is used, the result of the random input suggests a course of action or an answer to a thorny question. When Synchronicity is used, the player chooses the random input, and the Storyteller provides an oblique hint or opportunity to act that will either move the mage out of a static situation or alleviate a state of confusion, if interpreted with sufficient creativity. For example, let's say that the mage has been assigned to protect a young Sleeper, but, after a series of humiliating disasters, has lost all track of him. The mage casts Synchronicity and turns on the television. The current channel is running a documentary about chess. Knowing that this is somehow significant, she heads down to the local chess club, where she finds the kid sitting in on a game. Answers become clearer at a Potency of 3 or higher. For example, the chess documentary might include footage of the very chess club where the kid is playing. On an exceptional success, an answer suggests an obvious course of action. Here the willworker might see a live interview between the kid and a local news personality.",

Success causes a number of dice to be removed from the subject's dice pool for the next action he takes (i.e., the next action for which dice need to be rolled). One die is subtracted per Fate dot the caster possesses. Each extra success on the spellcasting affects one additional roll. For example, if the caster rolls three successes, he affects the next three rolls made for the target. Some mages prefer to cast the Evil Eye as a prepared spell with a conditional trigger. This approach allows them to delay the onset of the curse until the target performs a specified action (perhaps repeating the same insult that inspired the caster to impose this spell) or certain conditions are in place. The mage needs Time 2 or higher as a conjunctional Arcanum. See Prepared Spell and Conditional Trigger, above, for complete rules. Note: The Fate 5 Break the Chains spell can dispel the Evil Eye.",

The Imago of this spell involves the speaking of imprecational words about the target; of course, the spell is usually more powerful if this is done in the very presence of the target (or by sympathetic magic). Most often, though, the Silver Ladder mages speak against their enemies just before they see them. The penalties inflicted by this Evil Eye effect usually manifest in situations dealing with politics, interpersonal relationships or at moments when the target is in the public's eye.

		"Effect" : "Mages often become quite attached to certain possessions and want to ensure they don't become permanently lost. This spell helps to do just that. When cast on an item, this spell \"attunes\" it to the mage. If the two are separated without the mage's consent, forces conspire to return to item to its rightful owner. The \"Loyal Possession\" spell takes effect through a series of subtle turns of fate and slight of mind. The exact sequence of events is left to the Storyteller's imagination (with input from the caster's player, as desired). Sleepers can act as unwitting agents of a Loyal Possession without being consciously aware they are doing so, and seemingly \"random\" events can conspire to help get things done. Exactly how long it takes the object to get back to its owner depends greatly on circumstances: A small item could cross an urban area in mere hours, while a larger item could take days. There are also a few limits on the effect. First, the spell doesn't work if the item's owner willingly gives it away (even under duress). So if you hand a Loyal Possession to someone, it's effectively \"theirs,\" and the spell isn't triggered, but is actually transferred to the new \"owner.\" This can be used to grant others Loyal Possessions, however. Second, if the item ends up in the possession of an Awakened character, he can hold on to it so long as he keeps the item on his person. So if an Awakened enemy takes a Loyal Possession from you, for example, and keeps it in his pocket, it stays with him. However, as soon as the item is out of the Awakened character's possession, it may try to find its way \"home.\" So, if your foe happens to put the Loyal Possession down on a desk or side table, for example, the Loyal Possession might get picked up by a Sleeper servant or bystander, knocked out a window or into the garbage, and so forth, slipping the net to start its journey back. Finally, a Loyal Possession brought inside a ward loses its \"fix\" on its owner and cannot continue to return until the item is brought outside the ward, and the item can't influence events to help bring it outside. It becomes \"stuck\" in the warded area. Short of undoing the spell, this is the surest way to hold on to a Loyal Possession that doesn't belong to you. This spell is commonly imbued in certain valuable items, and a number of artifacts display similar capabilities (although artifacts are often more capricious about \"ownership,\" sometimes just conspiring to seek a new and suitable \"owner\" when circumstances require it).",

The mage does not really think out what he will do; he goes with the flow, letting Fate and his instincts guide him. He must not have foreknowledge of what he will encounter (a good hunch is one thing, but extensive scrying or a detailed description from someone on the scene via cell phone is not acceptable; such intimate understanding of the circumstances ruins the necessary randomness). For example, if the mage casts this spell in a bar upon meeting someone whom he considers ideal, he might easily wind up getting her phone number, thanks to his Fate-guided panache. Casting this spell over and over again in regard to the same subject (such as the girl at the bar) muddles the threads of destiny and may even hopelessly entangle them (the girl turns out to actually be a creepy stalker type or suffers from some less-than-ideal complication). In the most extreme cases, repeated castings may sever threads entirely (ending the relationship and perhaps even a life if the mage has been exceptionally presumptuous). More a roleplaying issue than anything else, this spell moves out of the realm of dice rolls and into that of manipulating the story. The mage effectively chooses some small thing that he wishes to see come to pass and makes it so through his magic. A Storyteller may levy dice penalties for highly improbable results (such as a pierced, tattooed and leather-garbed punk making a great impression at a black-tie affair). Generally speaking, favorable results of this spell do not last longer than the spell's Duration (unless the mage has subsequently taken non-magical steps to that effect). Unfavorable side effects can haunt a mage for quite some time. These are usually reversals of the exact same fortune the spell provided. Using this spell repeatedly against the woman in the bar might lead to an unfortunate encounter with her jealous ex-Mafia boyfriend, for example",

For a pocket watch, this mean until it winds down, while an intact, plugged-in clock normally only shuts off if unplugged or subjected to a power outage. A blender always creates a smooth, even blend, while a clock runs with absolutely perfect accuracy. In essence, such devices do exactly what they were intended to, effectively becoming physical representations of the Platonic Ideals of such machines. Even a shoddy looking device or one in poor repair (as long as it is mostly functional) can be enhanced by means of this spell to perform at 100% physical efficiency. The device is not any more resilient to damage than normal, so a stout blow to a perfected rock tumbler still damages or breaks it, but the spell does render the machine beyond the ken of normal environmental hazard (what constitutes a \"normal\" hazard depends entirely upon the device in question). A thermometer intended to measure the temperature of cooling lava has considerably different parameters for \"normal use\" than a refrigerator or a lawnmower. In game terms, dramatic failures associated with the \"perfected\" device are ignored. In addition, the device always works as it was designed. This does not mean a \"perfected\" car can be driven any easier in difficult conditions -- that's up to the driver's skill and the car's design (a sports car provides a better equipment bonus for maneuvering than a compact car). It does mean, however, that the engine won't overheat and the tires won't blow out (unless attacked). \"Normal\" use of the item in question is literally flawless. Most people don't know enough to know a \"perfect\" microwave oven from an ordinary one, so the risk of Disbelief is minimal. \"Perfected\" guns never jam, \"perfected\" light bulbs never burn out before the maximum possible amount of time, and \"perfected\" computers never experience those occasional little inexplicable quirks that plague most machines.",

These small manipulations of fortune almost always take the form of totally plausible situations, such as a parched mage finding that last quarter she needs on the sidewalk so she can buy a drink, or a sudden, stiff crosswind that turns a crack sniper's fatal shot into a serious wound. Big shifts, such as finding $1000 at the convenience store's front door or a piano falling on the sniper are simply too implausible to easily happen at this level of mastery. The mage simply requests some small jolt in the desired direction and allows destiny to make the decision as to how it comes about, meaning the mage should be on her toes, ready for anything in the event that her requested outcome happens in an extremely unexpected manner. A wish for \"a new car,\" for example, yields one up, but the mage gets it under circumstances that cause longterm possession to be undesirable (the car is stolen or haunted) or under which long-term possession is unhelpful (the car is faulty and quickly ends up collecting dust in a garage). These manipulations of destiny are small, but they may be undertaken for a wide variety of ends. Indeed, these tweaks can grow into something bigger and more meaningful if carefully tended. Mr. Right Now could, in fact, actually be Mr. Right provided the mage actually puts in the time and effort to bring such a relationship to fruition. Alternately, the $200 a mage hits on a scratch ticket might yield up many times its own value if invested wisely. This level of the Fate Arcanum helps destiny along rather than creating it, but it does give the mage the opportunity to seize her own fortune or to help make one for another. Successive attempts to use this spell for the same goal are considered vulgar.",

The \"bigger picture,\" or ultimate outcome of the subject's life, whether for good or ill, is revealed by a golden aura or a gray shroud around her, the intensity of which reveals the magnitude of the net effect she is destined to have on the world. A true saint is seen wreathed in a near-blinding radiance, while a cannibalistic serial killer who targets children would be shrouded by a deep leaden gloom. A mage can use this spell to read inanimate objects as well as living creatures to determine how pervasive the effects of entropy are on its structure and its ultimate fate, allowing the mage to determine whether a building is likely to stand for several more decades, fall into a lengthy state of disrepair before falling down (or being renovated). This spell reveals what might be considered the subject's default fate -- what will happen if destiny is allowed to run its course. With extraordinary action, the destiny revealed by this spell may be altered, at which point the spell may be used again at a later time to discern the subject's new destiny. This spell does sense, among other things, if the subject possesses the Destiny Merit, and a general sense of how strong the Merit is in that individual. The basic Fate + Death version of the spell reveals how strong or weak the subject's effect on destiny will be -- if he's a mover-and-shaker, or an average guy who will have little effect on the course of human (or cosmic) events. An exceptional success on the casting allows the mage to ascertain more specific information, including the ultimate cause, and possibly even the immediate circumstances, of the subject's death. The mage might briefly see his subject as she will appear after death: With a bullet wound to the head, or gray and withered from the wasting of cancer or with the grimace and clutching at the chest of one laid low by a heart attack.

The metaphysical weight of her vow is small and has little momentum, but such an oath can turn the tide in a mage's darkest moments, being the deciding factor that transforms disaster into victory. The oath gives the mage no bonuses to dice rolls or anything grandiose like that, but instead gives his player the opportunity to reflexively roll Resolve + Composure for the character to act in circumstances that would normally forbid action. For example, the mage is being controlled mentally and compelled to stand by and watch as the person she swore to protect suffers. A reflexive Resolve + Composure roll can be made for her to ignore the mental compulsion and to act to protect her charge. Also, at the Storyteller's discretion, when the mage undertakes some action that directly upholds the oath, she may regain a spent Willpower point, just as though she indulged her Vice. Note that a mage cannot cancel her own oath spell unless she knows Fate 4. She must dispel it if she no longer wants its effect. If the mage knowingly and willingly breaks the oath (in other words, is not compelled to do so), she suffers from the effects of the Evil Eye spell, an effect which cannot be undone by a mage with less than Fate 4. (This means that all the mage's dice pools are penalized by her own Fate dots until the oath spell is dispelled.) The mage cannot swear more than one oath at a time.

All such protections take the form of coincidence and happenstance that remove the target from harm's way, rather than making harm actually miss the target. If the target seeks out danger of the appropriate type, the spell still protects him once, but offers no further benefit. For instance, a Blessed target enters a burning building. The floor gives way under the weight of a couch before the character steps on it (thus avoiding injury or death for the target).

To provide meaningful results, the spell must affect at least 2 targets. The mage may visualize her search for information in any number of ways, but for game purposes it boils down to this question: \"Who is the most and least competent at (a specific activity)?\" To arrive at an answer, the mage reads the threads of destiny, following them to specific scenarios. The Storyteller responds by providing an answer based on the current, relevant dice pools of the targets. He doesn't reveal the target's game traits, only that a target would be the best or worst based upon those traits. For instance, if the mage is facing off against three marksmen, this spell usually reveals the shooters with the highest and lowest dice pools, but would not reveal that the worst shooter had a Dexterity + Firearms pool of 6. If the best and worst in the group are equally competent, the spell reveals this as well. Special circumstances affect the result. These include equipment bonuses, wound penalties, and magic; the caster isn't privy to this information. The spell reveals only relative competence based upon what might happen in the immediate future, so a gunman suffering temporary blindness would be considered worse than one who is usually an inferior shooter even if the blind marksman is due to recover his vision. For each additional level of Potency the mage can expand her understanding of the hierarchy of competence to add the next best or next worst targets, up to the limits of the spell's Potency or the number of targets, whichever is less/fewer. This spell can be combined with another to specifically target the best or worst member of a group. For example, it could be combined with Call Lightning to direct the spell at the target most likely to survive electrocution, or the one least likely to successfully counter the spell. This listing describes the instant version of the spell, but in ages past, mages cast extended ritual versions to find the weak and strong points in entire Consilii and battle formations.",

Note, however, that other Fate magics in the area work normally, including those that might indirectly target the caster, such as being caught within the area of a \"Swarm of Locusts\" spell.

She simply selects her destination, uses this spell and then all manner of coincidences help and even impel her along her way. When using this spell, the mage does not need to purchase a ticket in advance, and the total money spent need be no more than can easily be purchased with 1 dot of the Resources Merit. The primary thing the mage needs to do is to be willing to go along with the chain of events carrying her to her destination. If a mage in Chicago casts this spell to help her get to Los Angeles, a host of coincidences help her along her way. When she goes to purchase a ticket for an airplane or train, she is offered an exceptionally low fare as a special, a free ticket is handed to her by someone who is canceling his travel plans at the last minute, or some similar coincidence occurs. Traffic seems to move out of her way, stoplights turn green just as her cab approaches them, lines to checking in and security are exceptionally short, and her cross-country flight is not only not delayed, it benefits from strong tailwinds. A single success on this spell is sufficient to allow the mage to make an easy and low-cost journey to any destination in 10% below the absolute minimum time normally required. Each additional success reduces the time by another 10%. Even on an extraordinary success, this spell cannot reduce the total time by more than 50% of the normal minimum time, but it can allow a mage to step out her door and end up in a city all the way across the US at minimal cost in a matter of hours. Despite not requiring the Space Arcanum, this spell is still somewhat bound by the laws of sympathetic connection. The closer the connection a mage has to her destination, the easier this spell is to use. A mage using this spell to return home suffers no penalty. However, using this spell to travel to a distant city or nation the mage has seen only in photographs or on television gives the mage a -4 or -5 penalty, depending upon how many relevant photographs or TV shows the mage has seen. In addition, this spell bends fate, but cannot break it. Locations difficult to get to bring penalties. If the mage wishes to see the inside of some secure building like the Pentagon or Fort Knox, this spell might get her inside on a public tour, but it's not going to get her through high security checkpoints that do not allow unauthorized personnel inside. This spell will not allow the character to bypass or otherwise get around active opposition (like guards instructed to keep out all but a few specially authorized personnel).

		"Effect" : "Objects do not have volition of their own, but they are given momentum by the wills of the sentient creatures that act upon them. They are imbued with purpose by human belief in their designated purposes. Human choices become the destinies of such items. Thus, a mage with a stronger will than a Sleeper could, for example, decide that a rare heirloom will come into her possession. Through the quirks of fate, it eventually finds it way into her keeping. It may not do so in any way she might envision (and her ownership of it need not necessarily be legitimate or even legal), but she does not have to exert any special effort to acquire it. Indeed, she need not even know where the object is when she casts the spell. The item reaches her when it does, if it does (this spell could be dispelled before the item arrives; see below), and she has no control over the circumstances of how or when it arrives. Destiny makes no guarantees, for example, that a ritual knife a mage hopes to get won't end up protruding from a wound in her abdomen by the hand of some crazed wino. A mage can send a given object any which way she desires, specifying that a woman's gold necklace ends up owned by the son she gave away at birth, or that a treasure chest eventually spends its days at the bottom of the sea. Using this spell with naked and indiscriminate greed often results in dire consequences for the caster (such as the aforementioned knife in the gut). Wise workers of Fate magic advocate using this spell for personal gain only when need is great, otherwise doing legwork personally and without the aid of magic. Some items have so much belief and will behind them, conscious or otherwise, that it is essentially impossible to move them from their current circumstances. While the Hope Diamond might be able to be moved (at a -3 penalty for its celebrity), the Leaning Tower of Pisa isn't going anywhere, despite the fact that the technology certainly exists to disassemble, transport, and reassemble it. The threads of fortune can only be stretched so far. The Storyteller assigns a required target number (the metaphysical weight of the object's current destiny) that must be overcome in order to move the item in the desired direction. Thus, an object from a mage's own childhood about which no one else really cares might require only one success, while the mummy of Tutankhamen could require that 10 or more successes be accrued, if it can be moved at all. The targeted item can take some time to make it to its destination. Excess successes added to the target number can speed up the journey by one degree per success. This spell can target items within the Shadow Realm, although without a Spirit 3 component the item cannot cross the Gauntlet. It arrives just on the other side of the Gauntlet, probably brought by means of a hapless spirit. Using this kind of magic for selfish or greedy ends, especially when a mage does so repeatedly, almost always leads to bad twists of fortune, often involving one or more of the objects the mage tries to acquire. As with any spell targeting an unseen subject, the mage needs a Space Arcanum sympathetic connection to reach out and grasp the object's strands of fate to draw them to him. The strength of this connection determines if there are penalties on the spellcasting roll.<BR>",

These sorts of manipulations, having to overcome a certain degree of the subject's self-determination, can be quite difficult for even the most experienced of willworkers, so most undertake it only rarely. Each success on the spellcasting roll can be used to add one die to the target's dice pool for any action that might foster the fruition of the fate declared by the caster. Conversely, one dice penalty per success can be levied against rolls that might help prevent a subject's new destiny. The Storyteller determines when modifiers penalize an action, but they're often employed whenever the target tries to deny the fate that the spellcaster has imposed. The effect lasts for one scene. If sufficient Duration is not assigned to the spell, the being may not have long enough to see the action through. For example, rendering a person destined to buy a given used car in her hometown makes that fate likely (but not necessarily) to come to pass rather quickly, while giving a dog a destiny to kill a prominent recluse 2000 miles away may result in a fate that takes years to come to fruition.

The damage type does not change (sources of bashing damage still cause bashing damage, they just cause more than they normally would). Meeting a doom does not guarantee that the mage will suffer damage; it only worsens any damage that might happen to be inflicted. For example, a mage who enters a sanctum that is his doom has no more chance than usual of coming to harm, but should he accidentally fall down the stairs (or be pushed), his odds of suffering a lot of damage increase.

The spell itself does not create love, but gives it a supernatural depth. Lovers who undertake this spell must be very, very careful -- if love sours, this spell becomes a curse. The mage must join the lovers' hands as she completes the spell, and the lovers must make a declaration of their ardor for each other. This can be an elaborate vow or a simple \"I love you,\" but when the spell is complete, the love takes on a geas-like quality. This spell is always cast with a conditional Duration.

With this sense, a mage could listen in on a radio broadcast without the need for any kind of receiver. Likewise, she could watch any television signal not transmitted directly through cables. This would enable the mage to spy on closed walkie-talkie channels, get free satellite pay-per-views, or even \"listen in\" on the datastream transmitted and received by a cellular modem if she really felt like it (not that she'd be able to make much sense of it without the use of Mind magic to interpret the noise). She could even access wireless communications (such as MP3s, Internet long-distance phones, or video conferencing) at a wi-fi hot spot, although she can only listen to, not read, such transmissions. At this point, the mage is incapable of actually sending any information along these channels and is restricted to eavesdropping on extant signals. A Wits + Science roll is made for the mage to discern transmissions. Electromagnetism travels vast distances in a short period of time; signals are bounced all over the place by satellites (both natural and artificial), the Earth's atmosphere and various other things.

Being observed talking without sound is suspicious, so some mages utilize recording devices. Some record their altered voices (in which case they must be sure that the device can capture that range) and use them as personal journals, from which others will only hear static. Used to communicate, the altered voice can be played while the mage makes filler conversation, and the second mage listens to the recording.

If there are two or more equally viable functions with passcodes, the mage learns one of them at random, along with what it accesses. The caster must still have some means of inputting the code acquired with this spell. If the machine requires an input device (such as a key card or transmitter) that the mage doesn't have, then the code itself doesn't do much good.

For each success accrued in the casting of this spell, the mage may add a bonus die to all her non-magical rolls involving speech, whether trying to sway a crowd with her moving words, to threaten a stubborn Seer of the Throne into backing down, or to whisper at just the right pitch so as to be clearly heard by her companion and not at all by the guard standing six feet away. Forces takes all the auditory flaws out of the character's speech, allowing her to gain precisely the vocal quality she desires, while Fate takes care of any small variables: The mage finishes (or, if it is most advantageous, starts) speaking just before the car blaring loud music drives by outside, or she happens to stop right where the acoustics in the Consilium's meeting space are most favorable before delivering her scathing invective toward the Hierarch.",

Kinetic attacks (like fists and bullets) are as surely turned aside as energy-based ones (like a gout of flame or a laser), their momentum stolen or power leeched away. The mage gains one point of armor per dot he possesses in the Forces Arcanum. By spending one Mana, the Duration can be made to last for one day. Most mages cast such a shielding spell at the beginning of the day as part of their morning rituals. Successes are used to combat attempts to dispel the shield. Note that this magical armor does not apply against an opponent's attempts to achieve a grappling hold on the mage (the Fate, Mind, Space, and Time Arcana provide shielding spells to do that). Nor does it apply against a grappling opponent's attempts to overpower the mage. The spell does, however, protect against attempts to inflict damage upon the caster (subtract the armor points from any overpower roll that intends to damage the mage or attack him with a drawn weapon). In addition, the mage gains +1 die per Forces dot on rolls to resist being knocked down from applications of kinetic force, such as a hurtling wrestler or a stiff wind along a canyon edge (including attacks that cause the knockdown effect.",

He might have it cook him dinner while he watches TV, or lift buckets of water while he reads a book. Forces 3 allows for the accomplishment of one physical extended-action task through telekinesis (instant actions, such as fighting, are not possible). Successes are allocated to the telekinetic force's Strength or Dexterity, as per the Telekinesis spell. The caster must concentrate for the length of the task. If he is attacked or surprised, a Resolve + Composure roll must be made for him to maintain concentration. If concentration is lost before the extended action's target number is reached, the spell can be recast but all accumulated successes are lost; the spell must start from scratch. Mind allows the mage to devote part of his own brainpower to guiding the task, while he is able to perform a separate mental (not physical) action himself. He multitasks, as with the One Mind, Two Thoughts spell. Since he presides over the telekinetic operation, which does all the actual work, it is considered a mental task rather than physical one. The spell's telekinetic force performs the extended-action task, guided by a portion of the mage's own mind that is invested into the chore being performed. The dice pool is equal to the telekinesis' spell's assigned Attribute plus the mage's own Skill. A heavy-lifting task might require Strength + Athletics, cooking dinner or writing one's memoirs might need Dexterity + Athletics or Crafts, and picking a lock might be Dexterity + Larceny. With Mind 5, the mage can create a separate mind for the telekinetic force that can guide itself without his further involvement. He allocates successes between Strength, Dexterity, and whatever Physical Skill is needed for the task (it doesn't use the mage's own Skills, it has only those Skill dots that are allocated to it with spellcasting successes). If Space 2 is included, the Autonomous Servant can perform its task well away from the eyes and ears of the mage. For instance, he can get it to pick the lock to the wealthy financier's home while he chats up that financier at a gala ball across town.",

Once cast, this spell acts like the spell Magic Shield, providing 1 point of armor per dot of the caster's Prime Arcanum. In addition, the spell strikes the source of the magical attack with a bolt of kinetic energy, inflicting 1 point of bashing damage per success. However, the same energy that shields the mage is used in the attack, like a sort of \"point defense\" against the spell that blows through to hit the enemy caster as well. Reduce the number of successes calculated for the attack by the armor rating provided by the spell. For example, if the caster scores 8 successes and has Prime 3, the counterattack is only treated as if it had 5 successes. The caster may voluntarily reduce the armor protection granted by the spell to increase its counteroffensive ability. The counterattack does not use one of the caster's actions. If the spell came from an artifact or imbued item, the kinetic energy strikes that instead. By spending 1 Mana, the caster can make the spell last 1 day.

The caster can do so as many times as he wishes while the spell's scene-long Duration is still active (assuming he has enough Mana). The mage's Speed increases by itself again for each success on the spellcasting roll. Characters who run double this figure, as well.

In the early summer of 1920, while tourists flocked to the shores of the eastern United States, the bitter Obrimos waged war against the blossoming spirits of corruption and vice that were springing up throughout the area. A number of the mages of Phosphorous' Consilium were against these unprovoked attacks, and more than one chastised the Arrow for creating such a one-dimensional spell; what good would come of such destructive power? They soon found out when one local mystagogue got in over his head. \"Dapper\" Dave hadn't intended any harm by it, but whatever it was that he dredged up from the Underworld longed only to destroy. Phosphorous answered its aggression with the fury of her magic, unleashing this brutal spell upon the creature, until it troubled the Consilium no more.

Once he lets go of something --including another person, if he's carrying someone -- that item or person is affected by gravity normally.

Using this spell on a magnetized object, each success on the spell can increase or decrease the magnet's Strength by one. An object reduced to Strength 0 is still mildly magnetic, but probably not strong enough to support the object's own weight. One additional success can then reduce a Strength 0 magnet to a completely non-magnetized state. This spell can also be cast on objects that are not magnetized but can naturally be magnets. The first success then gives the object magnetic Strength 0, and additional successes allow the mage to increase that Strength. Objects generally return to their old state of magnetization once the spell ends. With Forces 5 and the expenditure of a point of Mana, the mage may make the change in Strength lasting as long as the material can naturally hold that Strength of magnetization. Any object can be permanently made non-magnetic; most magnetic materials have a maximum Strength they can hold, generally 2 or 3. Such a material increased to Strength 5 would naturally weaken to its maximum magnetic Strength after the spell's normal Duration expired. This spell may also be used to reverse a magnet's polarization, but the mage must use successes to make the magnet completely non-magnetized before she can apply any toward strengthening the reverse polarization.",

A success also reduces any Manipulation-based rolls (i.e., attempts to communicate) by one die per success, as well.

Note that if the target is a mage with at least Forces 1 or Mind 1, he might recognize (via Unseen Senses) that he is being manipulated. At the Storyteller's discretion, prolonged use of this spell (or if the caster gains an exceptional success) might cause the victim of the casting to gain a temporary derangement. This derangement grants either a mild version or upgrades a mild version to severe. This derangement lasts for 12 hours.

In the end, however, the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter depends on point of view. Certainly, Banishers have no qualms about using this spell in their fight against mages. The mage plants a destructive spell in a Sleeper subject, concealing a lethal time bomb within an unsuspecting person. This spell implants the Forces 4 rote Thunderbolt in a Sleeper. A Sleeper subject is procured by the caster, who proceeds to cast the Thunderbolt spell. At the very last moment, the mage channels the energy of the spell into the Sleeper, rather than at the Sleeper. This type of casting requires concentration and slows the spell from an instant action to a special type of extended action. The mage has a window of three turns in which to properly complete the spell, or the thunderbolt will be discharged targeting the Sleeper. The extended roll requires five successes. Once the spell has been set in the target, the mage weaves Fate and Time into the spell so it remains dormant until the Sleeper is in the presence of magic. The very next time a spell is cast within sensory range of the Sleeper, the Thunderbolt spell is discharged, targeting the source of the magic. The spell released in this way from a Sleeper requires no roll to hit. Damage caused by the spell is equal to the caster's Gnosis + 3. Changing the primary Arcanum of the spell could produce a variety of different effects. Cast with Matter 4, for example, the spell could incorporate the Transmute Air spell to transmute the air breathed out by the Sleeper carrier into sarin gas. Use of this rote is an act of hubris requiring a degeneration check for mages of Wisdom 4 or higher (roll three dice).",

This spell acts just like the Control Velocity spell, except that the mage can now cast it on living creatures or even on portions of objects (such as a truck tire, but not necessarily the rest of the truck, which surely causes the rig to jackknife unless the driver is very, very good). When the spell is cast on a living creature, its Speed trait is doubled or halved per success, but it is not in full control and reflexive Dexterity + Athletics rolls must be made each turn it moves or the subject suffers a knockdown effect. The creature's Speed is modified for the spell's Duration (default of one turn). In the case of projectiles, one success is enough to completely halt a projectile halfway in its path (or as close between there and its target as the mage desires). Additional successes can halt it closer and closer to its origin point, and an exceptional success can halt a bullet in the barrel of a gun. For instance, with two successes, a bullet is stopped after it travels only one-quarter the way from the barrel to its intended target (one success stops it halfway, while the second success halves that distance again).

This spell allows a mage to reach out with an arcane sense, to touch the subtle eddies life impresses upon the Tapestry, and thereby discern the nearness of other living creatures, from the most miniscule microorganisms to the most expansive flora and fauna. A mage typically specifies certain types of life to look for (\"white-tailed deer, salmon and humans,\" for example, or \"all insects\"), which is often a much faster proposition than singling out certain kinds of life to not look for. Without putting some kind of filter on his search, the mage is apt to get a uselessly overwhelming response. The mage might even be overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of living creatures to be found virtually anywhere on, in, under or above the face of the earth, from the depths of the seas to the outermost reaches of the atmosphere. The spell enables a mage to get a good sense of where these living patterns are in relation to him. By adding a Space 1 component to the spell, he can get an exact bearing on the detected life forms. The mage can detect life within his sensory range. In addition, while the spell is in effect, it creates a \"safety zone\" in a radius around the mage into which no living thing can enter without his knowledge. For example, if an assassin tried to creep up behind him, he'd know it as soon as the assassin entered the spell's radius.

A honeybee could be made to signal to others in the hive that it has found pollen, even when it has not, or a spider could be made to secrete venom from its fangs in the absence of prey. The mage can trigger whichever part of a base life form's fight or flight response she wishes, as well as compelling any base being with physiologically triggered instincts (such as a mother-wolf's instinct to protect her young) to engage in one or more of those instinctual behaviors through careful manipulation of brain and glandular chemistry. The mage can affect either a single target or all targets within a defined area. The creatures can be various types of vermin. In the case of a swarm of stinging insects, it usually attacks any person or persons within its radius. The damage the swarm inflicts depends on its density. All sizes listed deliver one die of bashing damage to anyone within the radius. A swarm can inflict more damage by condensing. Using the success chart, add one die per step smaller on the chart. For example, a 16-yard radius swarm (five successes) that condenses to a two-yard radius (two successes) inflicts four dice of bashing damage. Armor is effective only if it covers the full body, and then it provides only half its rating (rounded down). In addition, targets are distracted by the buzzing swarm, suffering -2 dice on perception and concentration rolls while they are within the radius, even if they're not specifically attacked. The insect swarm cannot be attacked with fists, clubs, swords, or guns. Only area-affect attacks such as a torch affect it. Each point of damage inflicted by a flame or other applicable attack damages the swarm's size. Once it's reduced to zero size, all insects are either dead or the few remaining disperse.",

Casting this spell removes the effects of fatigue and hunger deprivation, and allows the mage to regain one point of Willpower as though he had slept for a full night. Casting this spell repeatedly over a series of days, though, is difficult. Whenever the Banisher uses this spell, he is creating nutrients from his own body. Most people have enough body fat for this to work, but casting this spell does force the mage's body to feast on itself. Over a period of time, the mage runs the risk of losing too much body mass and suffering malnutrition (which this spell can't cure). In game terms, if a mage uses this spell for a number of consecutive days in excess of his Stamina, he suffers one point of lethal damage per day. So, if a mage with Stamina 2 uses this spell continuously, he suffers one point of lethal damage on the third day, a second on the fourth day and so on. This damage can't be healed magically, but if the mage starts eating normally again, it heals at a rate of one point per day. At Life 3, the mage can cast this spell on others.

In fact, these responses are so deeply ingrained and predictable that a mage knowledgeable in the Arcanum of Life can call upon these responses to induce a given animal to react in virtually any way he desires, within the animal's normal range of behavior. Because it is biologically possible to cow a 600-pound African lion into submission, the mage could, if he so wished, trigger the submission response in such an animal. Likewise, because a Yorkshire terrier has within it the potential to attack with relentless aggression, the mage can compel the dog to attack an adult human with all the fury (if likely none of the success) of a full-grown feral Doberman pinscher defending its territory against a smaller, weaker creature. This is not a mental compulsion, but a delicate manipulation of an animal's instinctual responses to situations (regulated by brain chemistry and the animal's glandular system). All this means that a dog can't, for example, be made to pull a loose strip of tape off of the top of a sealed box in order to open it neatly, since that response requires training and is not a function of the dog's natural behavioral template. Further, the spell does not create any kind of telepathic bond with the animal; the mage decides what he wants the animal to do. If the action is within the animal's range of normal behavior and reactions, it can be induced to experience the desired response. A clever mage can use this spell to affect an animal's emotional state in a manner that practically borders on telepathy, such as triggering a dog's pack hierarchy instincts to make it regard the mage not only as a member of the pack, but as its alpha. One success is sufficient to induce a desired, normal instinctual response in an animal. If, however, the animal is dead-set on a given activity (such as fleeing a mage who has violated its territory or attacking a vastly superior foe), a +1 or greater dice bonus might be added to its contesting roll.",

The item emits the distress pheromones of a wounded animal, triggering attack instincts of nearby predators. Depending on the location, these might include raptors, carrion-eating birds, coyotes, hyenas, hogs, wolves, bears or big cats. In urban settings, the greatest danger will come from domesticated dogs, whose feral instincts kick into overdrive when aroused by the presence of a cursed item. The density of dog populations in cities makes these items even more dangerous there than in wilderness areas, where predator populations are spread out in relation to their food sources. Still, a cursed item makes a handy addition to an enemy's sleeping bag as he prepares for a camping trip to a grizzly-infested mountain pass. A time interval passes between each serious animal attack, as determined by the amount of Mana spent during item creation. The item creator must also add five to the spell's target number per point of Mana spent. Item owners may suffer additional inconsequential animal attacks between intervals, most often from small creatures such as swallows or gerbils, who are incapable of infl icting measurable damage. Dogs may strain at their leashes but fail to escape from their masters to attack. Note that under some circumstances, for example, while the owner is behind the wheel of a speeding car, even a swarm of small animals could pose a serious risk to life and limb.",

Among other things, the mage could manifest gills, sharp claws, fangs (turning his normal hand-to-hand damage from bashing to lethal and adding one to two dice modifiers to attack pools depending on the weapon gained), cat's eyes (lessening by two penalties from all but absolute darkness), or a rat's digestive system (allowing him to safely digest all but the foulest food sources).

		"Effect" : "Using a combination of emotional suggestions similar to the Mind 2 Emotional Urging spell, barely perceptible telepathic messages and precise physiological control identical to that provided by the Life 4 Trigger the Lizard Brain spell, the caster can evoke a particular, visceral emotional response in the target. For example, by combining emotions such as greed with physiological reactions normally associated desire and interest, an otherwise honest official might be persuaded to accept a bribe. The most common use of this spell is to cause the target to have a particular positive or negative reaction to some specific event. A newspaper editor can be caused to dismiss a news story he might otherwise have published, and a police officer can be convinced to accept a somewhat dubious but non-magical explanation for a bizarre phenomenon that he just witnessed. In addition to such subtle and precise uses, this spell can also be used to completely discredit someone that the Guardians consider to be dangerous. By provoking completely inappropriate but powerful feelings of fear, lust, or anger, an individual can be made to appear overly emotional or even mentally unbalanced. If cast with a sufficiently long duration, the target might even remain unbalanced long enough to fail an initial examination by a psychiatrist and be committed for observation for a few days. Even targets who avoid acting inappropriately still experience all of the physiological signs of the desired emotion, including nervous sweating, a tremor in their voices, and other reactions that will cause anyone they are talking to take them far less seriously. Alternately, the caster can make targets seem far calmer and confident than they would otherwise feel. Depending Upon the caster's intent, the target adds or subtracts one die to or from every Social roll he makes while this spell is in effect. For example, if the caster wished to make a lawyer nervous and shy, the lawyer would subtract one die from all of her Social rolls for the duration of this spell. Since the target actually feels all of the emotional and physiological reactions produced by this spell, even if the actions that he takes while under its influence seem completely out of character, he is almost certain to come up with some reason for making this choice and will likely defend his motives and actions if questioned later.",

Guardians who work closely with the Labyrinth are particularly fond of this rote, because it allows them to make and break the people who lead the various cults and other organizations that make up this complex morass. Leaders whom the Guardians deem unsuitable appear weak or insane, while people the Guardians support seem unusually confident and eloquent. There are rumors that some Guardians have used this rote to do far more than depose minor cult leaders. Although many such charges are exaggerations, a few Guardians have used this rote to change the course of national elections during political speeches and debates, causing one candidate to appear far more sensible and suitable than the others.

This spell is based upon the Life 4 Doppleganger spell. While simply aping the shape of another person is often good enough to fool most observers, to the trained eye something is amiss, even if the perceiver has not rational explanation as to why someone is acting differently. Adding the Mind component to the spell allows the mage to pull enough knowledge from the target's mind to allow her to blend into her surroundings. The knowledge is appropriate to a certain location or set of circumstances, but isn't terribly detailed or specific; it's enough to get the \"lay of the land\" and know the routines of others who frequent the place or situation. This does not give the mage any special skills she does not possess, but allows her to pass herself off as if she belongs there.",

		"Effect" : "The mage takes on the physical characteristics, including Attributes and Size, of an average member of the biological type into which he changes. The mage learns how to alter his shape into that of any other form of natural biological life more advanced than a single-celled organism. He can become anything from an elephant or blue whale, to an earthworm or a black ant, to a fern or a wood mushroom. If he is not careful, however, he can lose himself in the mindset (such as it is in some cases) of whatever organism into which he transforms, his intellect overwhelmed by either instinctual responses and brain chemistry, or in the case of plants neurology completely unsuited to voluntary thought. The mage suffers dice penalties for Sizes significantly smaller than his own. To reduce oneself to Size 2 (cat-sized) is -1 dice, while Size 1 (rat-sized) is -2 dice, and Size 0 (ant-sized) is -3 dice. In addition, increasing one's Size can also levy dice penalties. See the chart below for this information. The mage may augment the Physical Attributes of this form with other magic, but cannot add the features of other living things to this changed shape (thus, while he could become a lion and could use spells to become a stronger, faster, more resilient lion, he could not also add wings to that form). Whenever the mage is faced with an overwhelming inborn response (such as a male lion's need to kill all cubs not sired by itself), Composure + Resolve must be rolled reflexively for the mage to assert his reason over his new instincts. Failure means that the sorcerer acts out the instinctual response. Note that none of the mage's clothes or gear is altered, and if he shifts to a creature of larger Size than himself, he\"d best remove his clothes (two to three turns) or they are ripped to shreds. If he shifts to a smaller size, his clothing might fall off of him. If the caster adds a conjunctional Matter 4 to the casting, his clothes and equipment can transform to fit the new shape and size. With Matter 5, his clothes and gear can be incorporated into his new form (his cotton shirt turns to fur or feathers, his holstered gun becomes an oddly shaped scar), and transform back into their original forms when the spell ends.",

In theory, anything from a slug to a bird to a dog to a chimpanzee can be physically manipulated in this way. The mage must touch the target (or its egg, or the belly of the beast carrying the unborn animal). The features are lasting. Effectively, the new form is considered the creature's natural form unless the being is altered again through another use of Life magic. The traits are hereditary, creating a magical bloodline. Mages who make fantastic creatures are well advised to hide them away from prying eyes, such as deep within an isolated sanctum or in the remote wilderness. Truly fantastic beasts created using the Fantasia spell (such as ambulatory pine trees with eyes, fangs, predatory instincts and the ability to spit digestive enzymes, or winged crocodiles with venom) tend to sicken and die when witnessed by Sleepers. The Sleeper's Disbelief successes (Resolve + Composure roll) deliver bashing damage to the creature once per scene in which it is witnessed, each time a new Sleeper sees it. The Disbelief dice pool may be reduced by one or two dice by playing to prevailing local myths (making a chupacabra in South or Central America, for example), or by putting an altered creature somewhere far away from the general run of humanity, where there are those who still believe the impossible can happen.",

It grows at a rate of one success per minute until the total successes required for that organ are achieved, at which point the organ is fully functional.

The willworker cannot regenerate someone who has died (perhaps due to the loss of the body part concerned). This spell does not affect the target's Health rating. Note: This spell's Duration can be extended using the advanced prolonged Duration factors, but it cannot be made indefinite. When the spell expires, the body part withers back to its state before the casting (and disappears in the case of a restored limb) within one minute.

By precisely balancing the forces of life and death within the target's body, the caster slows the rate by which the target ages by a factor equal to her level in the Death Arcanum + her Gnosis. A mage who has 4 dots in Death and a Gnosis of 3 who uses this spell on herself ages 1 day for every 7 (4 + 3) days that pass while she is under the influence of this spell. Mages who use this spell regularly often live for several centuries. Unless the mage learns 6 dots in the Life Arcanum, she cannot use the advanced prolongation table to cast this spell, and even then the maximum possible duration of this spell is only 1 week. Rolling a Dramatic Failure on this spell causes the mage to automatically age 1 year, which serves as a great disincentive against attempting to prolong this spell without using ritual casting. Most mages use ritual casting to allow them to cast this spell with a duration of several days. In addition, many mages who regularly use this spell mark themselves with a small tattoo or scar in the shape of the appropriate Atlantean runes needed to prolong the spell. If the mage rolls an Exceptional Success when casting Vital Balance she does not age at all for the duration. There are rumors of mages many centuries old who manage to regularly manage this level of success with the Vital Balance spell. The slowed aging due to this spell is compatible with the Death spell Steal Lifespan. It is also compatible with the Body Mastery spell, but the additional years granted by either of the aforementioned spells are not affected by the slowed aging provided by the Vital Balance spell; they are simply added to the mage's lifespan. In addition, this spell cannot be cast by or on a Tremere Lich; attempts to do either automatically fail. All other mages can cast this spell on both themselves and others with equal ease.",

At this level, the mage must touch the targeted liquid (or vapor) to be able to affects its adjacent volume or area. With Matter 3, he can cast this spell at sensory range. The mage can affect liquid vapor, like fog or mist, but not any substance whose single natural state is gaseous (like mustard gas or helium). He affects a volume of liquid or area of vapor based on successes rolled. He can also allocate successes to the density of the water, giving it Strength. At the Storyteller's discretion, a reflexive Dexterity + Crafts roll might need to be made for the caster to achieve a particularly complex shape, such as forming rain into the shape of a person. Exacting details such as facial features might even require an exceptional success on this roll. The liquid form is obvious for what it is. It cannot fool anyone into thinking it's a real version of whatever solid object it mimics (at least, not without an accompanying Mind spell to make the viewer think otherwise). The shaped liquid's surface tension depends on its Strength. If no successes are allocated to Strength, it has only enough to keep its shape. It provides no barrier whatsoever to obstacles or attacks, although it retains its shape for the Duration of the spell even when it is pierced by bullets or fists. Dots of Strength act as Durability (as with cover) against projectiles or other attacks that must first get past the shaped liquid to reach their target (unless the liquid is in vapor form, in which case it provides no protection). The caster can reflexively control and move the shaped liquid up to one yard per dot of Gnosis that he has per turn. If he uses Forces 3 in the casting of the spell, he can impart even greater motion to the water: 10 yards per dot of Gnosis per turn. People standing in the path of the onrushing water might be knocked over. If the water's Strength exceeds an affected person's Strength, a successful, reflexive Strength + Athletics roll must be made for that person or he is knocked down and swept along with the tide (as per the knockdown effect).",

The mage can cause any object or device, from a car to a handgun, to become temporarily conscious and animate. The willworker awakens the spirit within the object. Use the rules for the Spirit 3 Rouse Spirit spell to determine the rank and characteristics of this spirit. Also, the device can perform its designed function as well as if it was wielded by someone trained to use it. The object's dice pool for performing actions is always Power + Finesse, with no penalty for lack of skill. Because of the power of the Matter magics involved,the object can do more than simply perform its function. In addition to cars being able to turn themselves on and drive, guns being able to fire, and locks being able to lock and unlock, animated objects can also move on their own. Pieces of furniture can roll on their wheels or walk and run on their legs, knives and guns can hop around and even throw themselves at targets, and drawers can slide out with sufficient force to injure someone. When an object attacks, use the spirit's Power as its Strength. Animated objects can bend and flex in various unnatural ways. Most of their more extreme types of movement, such as a chair running across a room, are subject to Disbelief. One limit on this spell is that unless the mage also uses Spirit magic like the Control Spirit spell, the object is free to act as it chooses. Objects owned by the mage will typically obey her commands, as will objects not asked to do anything self-destructive or against their inherent nature. (Guns normally attack people, drawers and chairs do not.) Objects that have been treated well by someone will not normally attack this person. Guns owned by a gun collector who takes excellent care of them will not attack the collector simply because the mage asks them to. In fact, the guns are more likely to fire at anyone attacking their owner, including the mage who cast this spell. This spell can be used to animate any object of size 20 or less, +10 per additional Target factor.

A simple success affects an object of Size 5 or less. Each +5 Size requires an extra Target factor. Additional successes are applied to the spell's Potency, which is used to fend off attempts to control the object by other mages using this same spell. The object can move and perform simple actions. It has a very limited artificial intelligence, allowing it to perform routine, simple functions on command, such as picking up items and carrying them across the room. The object can handle only one such command at a time. With Fate 2 / Time 2, the object can be preprogrammed with one single function that the object performs on its own. With Matter 4, the object has the artificial intelligence of a dog, and can be trained just as well. At this level, the object can be commanded to attack someone, although its dice pool depends on the spell's Potency. Objects that are capable of picking up weapons, such as action figures with articulate hands, can wield them. (The animate object's Strength for lifting things is equal to the animating spell's Potency.) Use the object's normal Size, Durability, and Structure for when the object is attacked. If the amount of damage delivered to the object's Structure exceeds its Durability rating, it suffers a -1 dice penalty on all actions. Once its Structure points are completely damaged, it is broken and can no longer function. If the mage desires his animate object to have better sentience, he needs to use the Mind 5 Psychic Genesis spell. Note that this spell only allows objects to move within their normal capabilities -- it does not allow a statue to bend its arms or work its legs (that requires the Plasticity spell cast in combination with this spell).

Instead of affecting a single object, the mage can affect a number of bullets: One bullet per success. He can double this number for each additional Target factor he adds to the casting, with a cumulative penalty of -2 per extra Target factor. In the case of autofire, a short burst with the Armor-Piercing spell cast upon at least one of its three bullets gains the full effect of the spell for that burst.

Such a grimoire shows no visible sign of its nature: To read the grimoire, a mage requires both Matter 1 and Prime 1, to sense how the mystic pattern of the rote is coded into the crystal structure of the metal.

Many variations are possible. For instance, a Powersmith could bind a rote into a ring, re-learn the rote and so gain the grimoire's benefit to casting the rote whenever he wore the ring. Forge Masters in the Adamantine Arrow sometimes turn weapons into grimoires, so they can gain the same benefit by turning the rote mudra into a weapon-flourish.

The object's Durability determines the ease of the spell, levying penalties on the roll on a one-for-one basis. Wood (Durability 1) is easier to warp than reinforced steel (Durability 4 or higher). In the case of objects with mixed materials, use the highest Durability. Once cast, the effect takes place in the subsequent turn.

Thus, she could not transmute an entire car, but she could turn its fender to balsa wood or its frame to rubber. Transformations that involve precious metals or otherwise rare materials are not possible at this level. (That is, \"precious\" and \"rare\" by common Sleeper estimation.

Note that this spell does not alter the shape or Size of the object, just its material substance. Its weight becomes heavier or lighter by whatever degree is most appropriate for the new substance. With Matter 4, a solid object composed of more than one material can be affected with a single casting (although it must still be touched; Matter 5 is needed to transmute multiple solid substances at sensory range). The mage can affect multiple kinds of materials at once (such as the different parts of a revolver) or just one piece or sort of material. (Thus, she could transform the bullets, which are made of a number of substances, or just the hammer, or the entire weapon according to her wishes.)

Some mages are known to fling a fistful of small change or pebbles, transforming the objects in mid-flight to harry (or even seriously harm) enemies. Successes determine the number of objects (coins, staves) that are transformed, and the size of the swarm created. The creatures can be various types of vermin. In the case of a swarm of stinging insects, it usually attacks any person or persons within its radius. (The caster can direct the swarm with the Life 2 Control Base Life spell.) The damage the swarm inflicts depends on its density. All sizes listed deliver one die of bashing damage to anyone within the radius. A swarm can inflict more damage by condensing. Using the success chart above, add one die per step smaller on the chart. For example, a 16-yard-radius swarm (five successes) that condenses to a two-yard radius (two successes) inflicts four dice of bashing damage. Armor is effective only if it covers the full body, and then it provides only half its rating (rounded down). In addition, the vermin can be given venom if the caster imposes a -2 dice penalty on the casting roll. If a victim suffers at least one Health wound, he must contend with the venom with a reflexive Stamina + Survival roll. If it succeeds, he suffers no effect; if it fails, his physical-action dice pools suffer a -2 penalty for the rest of the scene or until he receives an antivenin (based on whatever creature the mage conjures). This penalty is cumulative. If a victim suffers successive bites and the Stamina + Survival roll fails, his penalties are added together. The vermin created are mindless and act solely on instinct (and thus this spell is best used to create naturally aggressive insectile vermin).",

The most famous version of the tale dates from 16th century Prague, where the Maharal, Rabbi Judah Loew, created a Golem to protect the Jews of his city from anti-Semitic violence. This spell bestows a kind of life on an inanimate figure, traditionally a humanoid figure sculpted out of clay. A single success is sufficient to awaken a single Golem of up to Size 5, but almost all Kabbalists spend a great deal of time and energy investing their creation with additional Potency and Duration factors. Some create Golems significantly larger than human size; for each additional 5 points of the Golem's Size, add one Target factor. The Golem has a Strength score equal to the spell's Potency, but has no other Attributes or Skills. Like an object, the Golem uses its Size, Durability, and Structure to determine the effects of attacks against it. When the Golem suffers damage in excess of its Durability rating, it suffers a -1 penalty on all actions. If its Structure points are completely depleted, it is destroyed. The Golem created by this spell has no true intelligence or initiative. It can understand simple commands, up to roughly the complexity one could expect a dog to follow, and can be \"programmed\" to respond to a specific stimulus with a single, predefined action (e.g. \"Attack anyone who tries to harm me\"). By adding Mind 5 to the spell, the mage may grant his creation a mind of its own. It may be worth noting that nearly all tales of free-willed golems end with the creature rebelling and killing many, sometimes including its creator. At Matter 5, the mage may use Advanced Prolongation factors.",

First, the mage prepares and ritually cleanses an altar, which is draped with a brown cloth (representing Malkhut) and on which the Golem's form is laid out. The mage need not sculpt the Golem himself, if he so chooses. Once the Golem is in place, two black candles (for Binah) are lit at the head and foot of the Golem, and the mage begins to carve sacred runes into the body of the inert statue (both to represent Hod and to provide the additional duration from Atlantean runes). The mage then chants in the accented High Speech favored by Kabbalists for thirty minutes before beginning the invocation proper, which involves readings from scripture and invocations to the archangels of the sephiroth. The traditional target number aimed for by Kabbalists is nine: Five applied to the spell's Potency and four to its Duration (allowing the Golem to exist for two days, or indefinitely if the caster is a Master, counting the Atlantean rune bonus), but the caster is free to set his own desired target number. Often, the rote concludes with the mage writing the Hebrew word Emet (\"Life\") on the Golem's forehead and setting the conditional duration to specify that the Golem will be destroyed if the first letter is erased, rendering the word Meit (\"Death\")."

This reduces the object's Durability and Structure. If the mage puts the compartment inside a machine, the compartment could wreck the machine by disintegrating key components to make room. The mage opens the compartment hatch by applying pressure in specific places and patterns. This is a mechanical effect, so she can teach another person how to open a given hatch. There's also a slight chance that a passerby might stumble upon the method. Observers can't see or feel the hatch without magic or supernaturally enhanced senses.

The mage affects a volume of air or gas based on his successes. When applied to air, successes are allocated between the volume affected and the increase or decrease in pressure (the density of air molecules), measured in Strength. When shaping air or gas, a Dexterity + Crafts roll might be required to achieve a particularly complex shape, such as forming air into the form of a person. Exacting details such as facial features might even require an exceptional success on this roll (although the air is invisible unless someone throws paint or mud onto it). Dots of Strength act as Durability against projectiles or other attacks that must first get past the shaped air to reach their target. When moving air, the Storyteller assigns a Strength rating to an existing force of wind. The caster can increase or decrease that trait by the amount of Strength allocated with his successes. A normal day might have only Strength 0, while a very blustery day might be Strength 1. A hurricane might be Strength 2 or even 3. The caster can reflexively control and move the affected area of air up to one yard per dot of Gnosis that he has per turn. If he uses Forces 3 in the casting of the spell, he can impart even greater motion to the air: 10 yards per dots of Gnosis per turn. People standing in the path of the wind might be knocked over. If the wind's Strength exceeds an affected person's Strength, a successful, reflexive Strength + Athletics roll must be made or he is knocked down. When applied to gas, the mage can control the vapor's flow, preventing it from dispersing into certain areas and even reflexively moving it at a rate of one yard per dot of Gnosis per turn (or 10 yards per Gnosis per turn with Forces 3).",

(Note: Transmuted versions of such materials are not acceptable.) The result, when properly crafted, a flawlessly mirrored substance. When charged with Mana, thaumium has a faint luminescence. A thaumium object may take the form of a necklace, breastplate, a watch, or a sword. The shape and size of an object is irrelevant to how much inherent countermagic it provides. One success creates a Size 1, Durability 1 piece of thaumium that has the ability to hold one point of Mana, which it spends to shield against magic. The mage needs additional successes per extra Mana point capacity, and successes are also added to the target number to increase the thaumium's Durability, Size, armor, and equipment modifier (all one point per success). (If a mage wishes it, she could create thaumium with no benefits beyond countermagic.) The alloy disintegrates when the Duration expires, so mages often cast this spell with an indefinite Duration. Use the Duration factors in the chart below. Once made, the thaumium must be charged with Mana points. Each time it shields against magic (a reflexive action unless the wearer does not want it to), it uses up one of these points. If it runs out of points, it cannot shield magic until it is recharged. This shielding takes the form of a reflexive counterspell, effective against any Arcana and both vulgar and covert magic. The protection's dice pool is equal to the thaumium maker's Gnosis + Matter. The wielder of a thaumium weapon can use the item's stored Mana to make the weapon's damage aggravated. This is a reflexive action requiring one Mana from the thaumium weapon's stores.

By casting this spell, the mage gains a sense for the unusual thought patterns that seep out of these beings, to leach into the Fallen World. Depending upon the particular qualities (and power) of the creature in question, its thoughts can leave metaphysical marks that linger for hours, or even days. By way of this spell, a willworker might learn, roughly, what such a being was feeling when it passed through an area (if, indeed, it is capable of any emotions analogous to those experienced by humans), what it was doing at that time, in which direction it was moving, and whether it is close by.",

Whatever the case, she figured out how to unlock the thing and a small horde of skittering things poured out of it from Elsewhere. Robert Baron, local leader of the Guardians of the Veil, however, happened to be a quick thinker, with a bit of experience summoning unpleasant things from worlds without names, and he recognized the telltale signs of alien entities. No one is rightly sure if he already knew this spell when he went on the hunt; if he didn't, though, he certainly came up with it with suspicious alacrity. Reluctantly, Baron taught his rote to as many mages as he needed to curb the infestation, and then he vanished inexplicably at its conclusion."

(Experience may not teach a mage the distinction between a cockroach's mind and a dung beetle's, but it does tell her the difference between an insect and reptile mind.) The mage detects the general type of mind she senses (a ghost, disembodied consciousness or spirit, for example) and this sense is useful for helping the mage to know when she is spied upon or just watched by a being currently lurking in refined dimensions.

A fatal shot to the chest could be turned into a graze, or a crippling blow to the leg might be reduced to a painful strike that leaves the leg functional. Such magic is of no help in dealing with attacks that cover a wide area (such as explosives) or those that don't depend on the mage being exactly where she appears to be (like a fall from a high ledge).

For example, if a mage has Intelligence 3 and Mind 3 and three successes are achieved on this spell to boost his Intelligence, that trait becomes six dots for the spell's Duration. If four successes were rolled, he could still only boost Intelligence by three dots, since he has only Mind 3. Raising Resolve and/or Composure also raises Willpower dots, but these extra dots do not provide Willpower points. The boost raises a target's Willpower capacity but not her actual supply of points. In addition, the target's Willpower cannot exceed 10 dots, no matter how high his Resolve and/or Composure is boosted with this spell. Example: Arethusa uses Augment the Mind to boost her Resolve. She gets two successes on the casting, adding two dots to her Resolve. This also adds two dots to her Willpower. She does not, however, gain two extra Willpower points. Note that the same spell cast to boost a different Mental or Social Attribute does not combine with the first spell -- only the highest Potency spell takes effect. For example, if a mage boosts his Intelligence by two dots and then casts a spell boosting his Wits by one dot, only the first spell applies, since it has the higher Potency. (With the Mind 4 Supreme Augmentation spell, the mage can allocate successes among different Mental and Social Attributes.)",

Would-be attackers look at the mage and find themselves psychologically incapable of attacking her in any manner. They can attempt to block the mage's path, but cannot attempt to harm her in any way. This spell works equally well on humans, animals and supernatural beings, but has no effect on any sort of automatic defense or anything completely mindless. In addition, this spell is insufficiently powerful to overcome the target's survival instinct. As a result, it functions only as long as the mage does nothing to directly threaten the target's safety. Record the number of successes the mage rolls on this spell. If a character who attempts to attack the mage has a Resolve score lower than the number of successes the mage rolled, then this individual cannot attack the mage. If the character's Resolve is higher than the number of successes rolled, then each success the mage rolled acts as 1 point of armor that is applied to all attacks on the mage made by the target. This armor comes from the attacker struggling to overcome the residual compulsion not to harm the mage. If the mage attacks a character or otherwise directly threatens a character's safety or the safety of someone close to him, he is then free to attack the mage, but still treats the number of successes the mage rolled as armor. In effect, the character is now treated as if his Resolve was higher than the number of successes the mage rolled. A mage using this spell can yell at people or berate them, but if she draws a weapon in a threatening manner or orders an associate to attack someone, then that person is free to attack the mage. If the mage actively threatens a number of people at once, such as by brandishing a gun in their general direction, they are all free to attack the mage. By spending 1 Mana, the duration of this spell can be made to last for 1 day. Many mages who use this spell cast it at the beginning of the day, as part of their morning rituals.",

If the victim fails the Resolve + Composure roll he must act within a few turns of the opportunity arising. He may use this time to minimize the possible consequences. The spell affects not only the initial target, but a number of people indicated by the spell's Target factor within its sympathetic range factor. The spell affects targets in order of their sympathetic connection. This is based on the target's sympathetic bonds, not the caster's (unless the caster inflicts the spell on himself). It is difficult for this spell to provoke truly heinous acts. If indulging the Vice would force a Morality (or the equivalent for mages and other supernatural beings) check, the victim gains bonus dice on the Resolve + Composure roll equal to half the difference between the character's Morality and the minimum Morality required to force a check, rounded down.

The spell reinforces the human mind's tendency to interpret unexpected sensory input according to familiar patterns. The spell is most often used to reduce the chances of a Paradox. The Sleeping witness interprets any overtly supernatural occurrence, whether generated by magic or by unnatural beings such as vampires or werewovles, as perfectly ordinary, if perhaps unlikely. Bizarre coincidences are written off to the vagaries of statistical chance. Lights in the sky become weather balloons. That car didn't rise up from the highway and take flight on its own; they must be filming a movie nearby or something. Sleepers under the influence of this spell cannot trigger Disbelief. They're not seeing a crazy, credulity-straining event; they're perceiving an equivalent occurrence that fits snugly within a materialist, logical worldview. When checking for Paradox, if all Sleepers who witness a display of vulgar magic are under the influence of this spell, no bonus is applied to the Paradox roll. Covert spells are never seen as Improbable. A dramatic failure on the casting leaves the targeted Sleeper more attuned to the supernatural, increasing the likelihood and severity of potential Paradoxes. A +3 dice modifier is applied to each Paradox roll for the duration of the current scene.

There are so many celebrities now, in so many fields, that it's impossible to keep track of them. A clever magician can use this to his own advantage, creating in the people he meets the rather unsettling sensation that the man standing before them is famous, and they know him -- if only they could remember what his name was. The mage gets preferential treatment. The best table in the restaurant. Front-of-the-line entry into the club without being on the guest list. He gets to misbehave -- within reason -- and given a lot more slack than a nobody would get. They indulge his eccentric behavior. He receives the perks of being famous without any of the trouble. Having said that, overuse of this spell can be risky. Conning the world into thinking you're famous is one thing, but having your picture taken while you're about your mystic business is quite another. Part of the effect of this spell is to make the target slightly star-struck. A target who's less likely to be impressed by a minor celebrity -- a cynical Hollywood agent, for example -- might get a bonus to his contesting dice pool of one to three dice. Likewise, casting False Fame on someone from a culture in which celebrity isn't a big deal -- a tribal culture in the developing world, for example -- would also give the targets similar bonuses to their dice pools, although in a world where subsistence farmers in rural India own DVD players, people who aren't impressed by celebrities are getting very rare indeed. Dots in the Fame Merit increase the Potency or Target factors of the spell, by one factor for each dot. Dots in the Occultation Merit subtract from the mage's dice pool.",

Thereafter, whenever the mage's Virtue is called into question, he must resist and deny that Virtue, or else risk losing some measure of his self-confidence and resolve (in the form of Willpower). To defy the ' demon of virtue,' the willworker makes a reflexive and contested roll of his Gnosis + Mind versus his Resolve + Composure. If the Gnosis + Mind roll succeeds, the mage may act according to his Virtue, but regains no Willpower for doing so. If he fails, he must act directly counter to his Virtue, as well as losing a point of Willpower. Whether or not the mage succeeds in contesting the demon, however, it remains for the full duration of the spell, unless consciously banished. Note that a willworker may cast this spell upon a willing subject with Mind 4, and upon an unwilling one with Mind 5. When the spell's Duration expires, the demon seems to depart completely, leaving no trace that can be followed, whether magically or otherwise. In reality, it leaves the mind and spirit of its host, fleeing into Twilight, where it recuperates from the strain of passage and gathers its strength before finding an appropriate place from which to propagate its Influence.

Affecting a print article, such as a newspaper story, requires Matter 2 instead of Forces 2. Anyone who reads, watches, or listens to the targeted piece of media will be subject to the affect of this spell. The subliminal message that the mage creates cannot be particularly complex. In most cases, it simply causes the viewer to be far more or less skeptical of this or some specific, related piece of media. This spell can also be used to produce other emotional reactions to specific pieces of media, including anger, belief, or joy. None of these emotions are particularly powerful or complex -- readers or listeners are simply more inclined to feel a certain way about the information. However, if a particularly listener is strongly inclined to feel otherwise about the piece of media, this spell cannot override such a strong conviction. Although the thoughts and emotions produced by this spell only directly affect the target while he is watching or listening to the media containing the subliminal message, the effects of these thoughts and emotions generally linger well beyond the end of the spell. If the mage is using this spell to affect viewers' reactions to a story or rumor other than the one that she is placing the subliminal message in, then the spell becomes more difficult. A closely related story is one on the same topic, such as a specific UFO sighting or a particular fire in a warehouse district. A distantly related story is one that is about UFOs, fires, or the warehouse district in question. Much of the power of this spell comes from the fact that Sleepers are trained to believe in the mass media. While this spell can be used to implant subliminal messages that make Sleepers less likely to disbelieve evidence of magic, impose a one die penalty on any such rolls, because even the mass media has difficulty overcoming the great power of the Abyss.",

The question can be anything. As long as the target can hear and understand the mage, the target can be doing anything, even trying to attack the mage. If the spell succeeds, the target stops what he is doing and thinks about it, and perhaps talks to the mage for a while. The effect is broken if the subject is attacked, or put into some sort of danger. If the mage achieved an exceptional success, there's no immediate mechanical benefit, but the subject of the spell takes the question to heart, so that at some point in the next few days, he re-evaluates his life.

		"Effect" : "The mage peers into her subject's mind and forges a connection between one topic and one powerful emotion. For the duration of the spell, the subject's emotions are no longer his own when that topic comes up. The mere mention of the trigger topic might enrage him, delight him, or send him into a downward spiral of depression. While this doesn't give the mage control over the subject, it gives him an edge when the subject is responding to the trigger topic. This is a highly versatile spell, and mages have used it for a variety of purposes, from breaking up relationships, to defending the Veil, to killing enemies. This spell connects one topic of the mage's choosing to a strong basic emotional response in her subject -- anger, joy, shame, sadness, or fear -- and any time that topic comes to the subject's attention, whether in conversation or just through happenstance, it triggers a massive emotional response of the programmed type in the spell's subject. If a topic brings up joy, the subject might not be able to stop talking about it (because doing so brings up such joy). Likewise, discussing other topics might have an equally powerful impact with other feelings. The emotional impulse generated by this spell doesn't give the mage any control over how the subject responds. The spell links one topic with one powerful emotion; the spell does not determine how the subject responds to that emotion. People might grow quiet due to shame, belligerent due to anger, talkative due to joy, detached or morose due to sadness, or nervous and skittish due to fear -- but the mage can't predict with any certainty how any given emotion is going to affect a particular subject. While a mage might expect that a big loud oaf might get violent when he gets angry, and while that's probably the way to bet, the mage can't be sure unless he's familiar with how his subject responds to certain emotional cues. To improve the mage's chances of using this spell effectively, the mage may make an extended Intelligence + Empathy roll to first study the target over time and predict how he is likely to react to a given emotion. The target number is equal to the target's Composure, and he can make one roll per hour of observation.",

This variant of the spell links that topic to the subject's deepest shame. The mage determines one topic that he does not want the spell's subject to talk about -- magic, for example, or the name of the person who supplied a murder weapon or anything else -- and for the spell's duration, that specific subject is wrapped in a cloak of shame in the subject's psyche. To talk about that subject feels like blabbing the most sickeningly embarrassing and awkward topic possible, although the spell does not actually prevent the target from talking about it, should someone convince him to speak his shame."

On a failed roll, the owner becomes fiercely protective of the item, and spends a period of one hour per point of Potency suffering severe anxiety over the thought of the object's possible destruction.

Affected owners must do everything in their power to prevent the item from being harmed.

On a failed roll, the mage is convinced that the item is not cursed, regardless of any supernal perceptions to the contrary. If the mage failing the roll is not the object's owner, the mage is possessed by an intense desire to become the object's owner. This powerful obsession lasts for one hour per point of Potency.

Instead of reading individual minds and sifting through their thoughts, this spell allows the caster to get a vague and general sense of the attitudes and feelings of a large number of people. To cast this spell, the mage must be exceedingly familiar with the region where he is casting it. This region can range from a large apartment building or a neighborhood of few city blocks to an entire city. Use the rules for area-affecting spells, but with the special chart below. When casting this spell, the mage can attempt to get an exceedingly vague and general impression of what the people in the region are thinking about. Used in this fashion, the spell only reveals thoughts shared by a significant proportion of the people within the area. In addition, this spell only provides a very brief and general impression of such shared thoughts -- the caster might discover that most everyone within a single city block is thinking about the recent power outage, the widespread job cutbacks in the area, the noisy roadwork on a nearby street and rumors about a woman who appeared out of midair three days ago. Alternately, the caster can use Mind 4 to determine if a particular name, image, sound, face, or some other short phrase or simple sensory impression evokes a strong response from the people in the designated area. When used in this fashion, the spell both reveals the approximate proportion of the people who feel a particular way about the image or phrase and roughly how they feel about it. With the addition of Time magic, this spell can also be used to determine how residents of this region responded in the past. The complexity of receiving and analyzing so much information is the reason that this spell can only be performed as an extended action. When performing it, the caster typically sits down in front of a map or photograph of the area he is going to examine. He then sinks into a deep trance that continues until he either successfully casts the spell or gives up the attempt.",

				"RoteDescription" : "The oldest known use of this rote dates back to a Consilium in 13th century Spain. A Mastigos Guardian now known only by her Shadow Name, Lucia, was following the trail of a Tremere lich who had allegedly infiltrated the Consilium. Unable to piece together the fragmentary clues left by the Left-Handed Necromancer, the Warlock turned to other options. In secret, she studied her fellow mages through scrying portals, calling their foremost conscious desires out of them, so they could be studied and the truth of the matter discerned. Lucia never found a lich, however, as none existed within the Consilium to find. Instead, she discovered that the rumor had been seeded by two Seers of the Throne who had quietly replaced Councilors, and that they were using the paranoia that the story engendered to gradually weaken any hope of concerted resistance when the time came for their allies to strike. Armed with this knowledge, Lucia petitioned for, and received, permission to eliminate the threat."

Successfully casting this spell upon oneself summons one of the mage's own morpheans as a presence in Twilight. The willworker may interact with this dream-fragment as she sees fit. Some simply call up dreams of aspects of the subconscious to explore (or enjoy) them, while others use this experience as a crucible; relentlessly analyzing subconscious desires. The mage's most pressing present subconscious desire is drawn out of her, taking on ephemeral form. If the mage is dreaming or otherwise in direct contact with her subconscious, then she may choose the specific aspect of her Oneiros that she calls forth. With Mind 4, a mage whose consciousness is presently in the Temenos or the Dreamtime can spend a point of Mana to attempt to summon a morphean out of another individual who is physically present at the location of her body. With Space 2 and Mind 5, she may attempt to do so at sympathetic range (again, spending a point of Mana), though she must still be within the Temenos or Dreamtime, and the morphean will appear in Twilight near the summoner's body. Note that this process does not enable a willworker to actually enter the Oneiros of another; merely to call morpheans out of Oneiroi.",

With some creatures (goats or exceedingly alien spirits, for example) this is largely an exercise in futility and frustration for anything more complicated than the most basic of concepts. Ideas, images and words can all be shared freely between the mage and another individual. The target cannot be compelled to act in any particular way, although the mage could use the telepathic link to try to socially persuade him (or to use other spells that do allow for psychic command). Only conscious thoughts are gleaned at this level. It requires Mind 4 to read someone's subconscious thoughts. The Duration at this level is transitory. Additional successes extend that time. With Mid 4, the mage can cast this spell with a prolonged Duration. With Mind 5, he can use advanced prolonged Duration factors. Those with telepathic abilities (whether bestowed by this Arcanum or by some other source) may sense the mind-to-mind contact initiated in their vicinity (if successes on an instant Wits + Occult roll exceed this spell's Potency). Such an observer may attempt to \"barge\" into the contact (if the newcomer also has Mind 3), which requires a contested Resolve + Composure roll against the casting mage's Potency on the spell. More minds can be contacted by adding Target factors to the casting, but those minds have only two-way communication with the caster. The willworker does not serve as a \"psychic switchboard.\" With Mind 5, multiple minds can be \"networked.\" This web can be intruded or spied upon in the same manner as ordinary one-on-one telepathy by those with the means.

The autopilot's Attributes and Drive Skill may be increased by extra successes on the casting roll on a one-for-one basis. The autopilot cannot communicate with the caster or anyone else, but it understands and obeys the caster and anyone the caster designates when the spell is cast.

An individual could be made to forget where she parked her car, the fact that she likes strawberry ice cream, or even why she wears a wedding band. Naturally, short-term and less deeply ingrained memories are easier to manipulate than those that are long term or more fundamental to a person's identity, but just about any memory can be sculpted according a mage's desires. The mage might suffer a penalty, depending on how deep the memory to be altered lies. Once the spell expires, the memories return. During the spell's Duration, psychotherapy and hypnosis might be able to restore the victim's memories. Each success on the spellcasting roll levies a -1 dice penalty on any attempt to restore the subject's memory to normal (or to otherwise influence an implanted or altered memory). A subject cannot be made to forget that she is Awakened (or is otherwise a supernatural being of some sort) or how to use her paranormal abilities. That part of her identity is too deeply bound into the mind and soul alike to be tampered with. Virtue and Vice may not be changed at this level. They are facets of who a person is, rather than just a product of her memories. If a target is a mage with at least Mind 1, he might have an inkling via his Unseen Senses that he is attacked mentally. A reflexive Wits + Composure roll allows him to sense attempts to alter his memories. He can know nothing about the intrusion unless he casts magic (such as Third Eye) to learn more.

Use the rules for Goetic Evocation to design the spirit based on the number of successes scored. Instead of Possession, eidolons automatically start with the Living Fetter Numen. The mage's personality and beliefs control an eidolon's appearance and shape. The spirit takes an appearance that the mage associates with goodness. The spirit could look like a radiant, winged angel, one of the 18 Buddhist arhats, or like a historical figure she's always admired. In most cases, the eidolon either looks something like the mage or appears to be a parent, lover, or close friend. An eidolon can't be forced to give its mage Willpower points. On the other hand, it will explicitly point out opportunities for the mage to fulfill her Virtue, increasing the likelihood that she'll earn back spent Willpower points by \"doing the right thing.\" An eidolon also opposes its mage whenever she looks likely to either satisfy her Vice or act against her Virtue. Depending on the eidolon and the situation at hand, the spirit uses everything from calm conversation to physical intervention to keep the mage on a righteous path. Unlike a goetic demon, an eidolon is not automatically bound to follow the mage's orders, but it feels a duty of care and will usually help its host unless she's planning an immoral act. An advanced version of the spell, using Prime 5 and Spirit 5, can evoke another person's eidolon.",

Kabbalists see this as a form of metaphysical \"climbing\" of the Tree to reach the higher sephiroth and greater understanding. Traditionally this is accomplished by intense meditation and prayer; this spell allows the Kabbalist to make the journey more literal. This spell must be cast in conjunction with an astral journey. Upon casting this spell, the mage shapes the Astral Plane around him into a representation of one of the sephiroth he has gained an understanding of (that associated with the conjunctional Arcanum of the spell). He can interact with the angels and spirits of that sephira and gain wisdom and understanding of its principles. The exact effects of this wisdom varies; in general, if the mage overcomes the challenges and seals that guard the sephira's mysteries, he should earn 1-3 Arcane experience points depending on the difficulty of the challenge. According to Kabbalist doctrine, the key to Ascension is to use this spell to journey completely up the Tree of Life, from Malkhut all the way to Keter, navigating each sephira in turn. This obviously requires considerable mystical power, and there are few if any reliable cases of a mage achieving this goal.",

This rote is one of the more subdued Kabbalistic rituals: The mage dons a purple robe (even if Yesod is not his ultimate destination, it is the traditional \"beginning\" of the road). Surrounded by foci that represent his goal, the mage meditates until he slips into the Astral Plane, then continues meditating on the names of God and the archangels of the sephiroth. When the spell is complete, the mage enters the \"realm\" of the sephira, and can interact with its inhabitants. If he overcomes their challenges and riddles, he may gain enlightenment. If he fails, the result could be messy to say the least."

The rules are the same for the Psychic Projection spell. However, while moving about Twilight, the mage's projection can move seamlessly through the gathered minds, learning new things. After the scene is over and the mage returns to his body, he learns a number of new Skill points equal to his Gnosis score, with the player essentially adding temporary dots to the character's current or non-existent Skill ratings. No more than two dots can be added to a single Skill in this way. The Skill boost is temporary, lasting for 24 hours. After the 24 hours, the Skill dots \"burn off\" at the rate of one dot per hour (Storyteller's choice as to what order they fade).

The goal of the gathering matters little (Burning Man offers a generic focus on creativity, self-reliance, and ecstasy while something like the Harmonic Convergence was a conscious attempt to turn humanity's collective soul toward positive karma and dharma), but the gathering of people is a focus. Also important is that a number of the gatherers must be operating with some manner of psychoactive in their bloodstream (the number of dosed individuals isn't a hard or fast number, but one can assume that approximately 1/4 of the attendees should have recently imbibed some kind of entheogen). Another focus of the festival is a key symbol that serves as the literal center of the activities. At Burning Man, it is obviously the giant effigy (which may actually burn or may be a figure comprising neon tubes and car parts), while at other ceremonial festivals it may be a central tree representing Axis Mundi or a sacred figure (such as Om, some kind of Buddhist mandala, or a figure from Native American or Japanese symbology) laid across or etched into the ground. Music is the final focus. It may come from a drum circle, or may instead be trance music pulsing from a tower of speakers. It doesn't matter what kind of music it is, only that it's loud enough for the crowd to hear it. The caster then literally surfs the crowd - they pick him up and carry him about. While atop the crowd, he projects psychically, his limp body carried by the crowd until the scene's end."

In the case of tactile sensations intended to hinder or incapacitate, such as a hallucination of a guard who grabs the target by the shoulder to prevent him from entering a room, the dice pool for the image's \"physical\" action is equal to the caster's Gnosis. Of course, the hallucination doesn't actually grab the target through physical means. It is merely a convincing illusion, such that the target is fooled into thinking that the guard touches and hinders him. The caster must either give the illusion a specific \"programmed\" action, or maintain concentration per turn, directing the illusion to do whatever he wants it to. The programmed action must be very simple, such as a person walking one way down a street and ignoring others.

By means of this spell, the target is rendered unable to \"achieve forgiveness,\" as Kabbalists put it. In game terms, this takes the form of a compulsion forbidding the subject from increasing his Wisdom or relevant Morality Trait for the duration of the spell. The subject, of course, does not think in terms of ratings and experience points; the compulsion merely prevents the subject from coming to terms with his own sins. Moreover, should the target lose a point of Wisdom for any reason during the spell's duration, he takes damage equal to the spell's Potency (reduced by armor if the subject's armor can protect against fire) as invisible whips of flame scour his flesh. Note that suffering this damage does not end the spell -- flagrant sinners can be (and have been) killed by this spell. At Mind 5, the caster may use Advanced Prolongation factors.",

				"RoteDescription" : "Because of the elaborate casting ritual traditionally involved, many Kabbalists incorporate Space 2 to cast this rote sympathetically. The Pulsa di Nura, as this spell is traditionally named, begins in the Kabbalist's preferred ritual space. An altar draped with red cloth (for Gevurah) and set with purple candles (for Yesod and Death) is the centerpiece of the ritual. As with most Kabbalist spells, it begins with chanting in the High Speech for a half an hour. Once the ritual proper is begun, the mage takes up a silver dagger (representing both Chokhmah and his desire to do harm), with which he traces the names of Michael and Kamael in the air above the altar. Finally, at the completion of the casting, he pierces an image of the desired target (or another object which has sympathy to the target) with the dagger, then transfers the object to a burning brazier to be consumed. If the ritual is performed during the astrological hour of Mars (for example, at dawn on a Tuesday), the Mana cost is waived. There is no common consensus as to the appropriate number of successes the willworker should target with this spell. Most agree that it should last no less than two days, so five successes are often allocated to Duration; alternately, the spell's conditional duration is often set so that the spell expires if the target deviates from a course of action the caster finds displeasing -- for example, a Pulsa di Nura cast on a businessman might be set to end if the target gives up his efforts to buy the apartment building that houses the mage's sanctum. Successes devoted to Potency range from one (if the caster only wishes to gently goad the target) to ten or more for truly Biblical-scale vengeance."

With Matter 3, words on paper can be copied into thoughts and then stored. (Neither the mage or the target needs to read the words.) Forces 3 allow bytes of data to be copied into thoughts. (With Matter 4 or Forces 4, the information can be transformed into thought, removed from its source and stored in the target's mind -- leaving the book or data sector blank.) The amount of information that can be stored depends on the successes gained. Note that this spell does not allow the mage to understand or process this amount of information; he merely moves it from one source into a portion of the mind for storage. When the spell expires, the stored information is erased (unless Matter 4 or Forces 4 was used, in which case the information is transferred from the mind back into its original form, as words or bytes; a storage medium is still required for it -- a blank book or disk -- or else it is then lost.) The target cannot access the stored information herself, unless she can cast a Mind 3 version of the Mind 4 Read the Depths spell upon herself, to read her own subconscious. By adding Fate 2 for a conditional duration, the caster can choose a keyword that, when spoken by or to the target, unlocks the spell, releasing the information. (If only Mind was used, the information is released as a telepathic burst; Matter or Forces copies the information back into the form it was copied from -- if no blank book or disk space exists, the information will overwrite whatever is handy.)",

The object of the magician's affection gets sweaty, or feels flutterings in his stomach. He experiences -- for a brief period -- all the physical and emotional sensations of being madly in love. In the end, the Love Spell forces someone to want love -- and probably to want and have sex -- against that person's natural will. Although no mortal court could ever return a conviction, many mages see no real difference between forcing someone to want to have sex with you and simply forcing someone to have sex. The Striking Looks Merit adds one factor to the Potency or Duration of the spell for every two dots possessed in the Merit (that is, Striking Looks 2 adds one factor; Striking Looks 4 adds two factors). An unlikely match might inflict penalties of -1 dice or more to the mage's dice pool. If the attraction is particular unlikely (for example, in the case of a homophobic heterosexual man of strong religious convictions who is made to fall in love with another man and spend the night with him), the Aspect of the spell becomes Improbable, and the mage must spend a point of Mana to cast it.

Whether to make the soul stone concealable, transportable or simply beautiful, a mage can use this spell to change the shape of her soul stone. The mage must touch her soul stone in order to affect it with this spell. She requires only one success on the casting, after which the stone changes to whatever form she desires. Simple shapes are easiest -- stones, blocks, things that appear to be plants or parts of a creature. If she wants to make the soul stone appear as something strongly contradictory to the nature of her Path, she loses two dice from her roll. Making a Moros' stone appear as any living thing or an Acanthus' as a shard of bone would qualify. Forcing the soul stone to hold the form of something more complex, such as a pistol or a light bulb, is harder. Doing so requires an extended Intelligence + Crafts roll to build the Imago, because the mage must fully understand the target object, before a successful casting of the spell. The target number might be three successes for a light bulb but five for an automatic rifle, and each roll takes 15 minutes. If she insists on changing her soul stone's form without crafting the Imago carefully beforehand, she subtracts a number of dice from her roll equal to what would have been the target number on the Intelligence + Crafts roll. Such an involved process is only necessary if the mage wishes her soul stone to be a functioning tool. She can make it appear to be a gun or a yo-yo while sparing the complexity with much greater ease. With five dots in Mind, a mage may use this spell on another mage's soul stone. Unless the other mage is present and willing, his soul stone naturally resists the change by subtracting its creator's Gnosis from the casting roll.",

A person may refuse the automatic summons, in which case the Mana is not spent.

Its replies appear in print, though the book can provide pictures from its own memories. Some books show these pictures as elegant line drawings, others show photographs. The copy of the mage's mind remains in stasis until the book is opened and read, though it does remember conversations with previous readers. The book's Social Attributes, Mental Attributes, and Skills are allocated as they are with the Psychic Genesis spell, capped by the caster's own Attributes and Skills. The book possesses the caster's Virtue and Vice as well.

A servant with one point of Potency has a flame that has the size and produces the heat of a torch. If the fiery creature tries to burn a person, it has an attacking dice pool equivalent to its creator's Gnosis + 2, and causes lethal damage. If the creature causes more than two points of damage on its first attack, the creature sets its target on fire, causing another point of lethal damage every round following, until the fire is put out. Although obviously magical (and subject to Disbelief), the creature is made of nothing more than fire, and can be destroyed immediately by a fire extinguisher or a large bucket of water.

He could put the mind in a form incapable of anything other than telepathic interaction, but such is exceedingly cruel and almost always leads to the creation's insanity, unless the consciousness is frequently interacted with or created without a need or desire for contact.

Additional successes are allocated to increase the mind's Mental and Social Attributes on a one-for-one basis.

The mind has as much of its creator's basic personality and memories as the caster wants it to have (although its ability to reason using those memories or even recall them when needed is based on its assigned Intelligence). By adding other appropriate Arcana to this spell, such a mind could be tethered to a vessel made specifically to hold it (such as a body created with Life 5). Note that at this level of mastery, this spell cannot be given an indefinite Duration (i.e., the mind cannot have a \"natural\" life span of human years). The consciousness dissolves when the spell expires. Unless the creation is specifically designed to accept the inevitability of its own dissolution without emotional trauma, a Wisdom degeneration roll may be required for the creator (unless he has Wisdom 2 or lower). The mage could, however, recast the spell before the previous one expires, giving the mind a new Duration. Note that such extension is an exception to the normal rules for spell control.

But, when Guardians fail to execute this heavy burden, others must sometimes sully their own hands with ugly necessities. Accepting the price of his failure, however, a Guardian can assimilate the wickedness of others and purify it in the crucible of his ongoing sacrifice, redeeming the virtuous and embracing his own damnation thereby. This spell enables the Guardian to do just that, drawing out the sins of others and taking their weight upon his own soul, so sparing them the pain of wickedness and nudging them back toward virtue. Upon successfully casting this spell, the Guardian takes on the spiritual burden of the most recent sin against Wisdom for which another mage suffered degeneration. (Use the Duration factors given for prolonged spells to determine how far back the caster can reach in his attempt to consume the subject's sin.) There exist certain interesting complications to this process, however. First, the subject must be willing and desirous of sincere repentance. Of course, part and parcel with a failed degeneration check is a feeling of vindication in one's improper actions, so this true longing for redemption is often easier said than done, and usually works better with either those who are, by nature, intensely virtuous or, conversely, those who have perceived an overarching pattern of wrongful behavior in themselves and wish to turn back from the path of hubris. Whatever the case, it is only a genuine commitment to self-betterment that empowers this spell's soul-mending effects. Second, the spell isn't a guarantee; merely a chance. The subject receives the opportunity to re-roll the degeneration check, automatically subject to a +1 die bonus for sincere remorse. If this check succeeds, though, the subject regains the lost Wisdom without cost and loses any derangement gained through that particular instance of degeneration. (derangements from other sources -- including other instances of Wisdom degeneration -- remain.)  Third, the Guardian can cast this spell only once on a given subject between instances of degeneration. (In other words, no \"going back\" to the next instance of degeneration and trying to undo that one as well, thus enabling another willworker to potentially skyrocket in Wisdom.) Fourth, the Guardian must pay the piper, as it were, by accepting the burden of sin upon his own soul (and regardless of whether or not the subject actually succeeds in his \"second chance\" to feel regret for his prior actions). In the case of any act at least 2 dots above the Guardian's present Wisdom score on the hierarchy of sins, this entails no degeneration check: His soul is simply too scarred already to suffer appreciably on account of this new burden. In the case of sins within one step of the Guardian's present Wisdom score, in either direction, this involves a degeneration check for the Guardian, as normal, subject to all the customary consequences for either success or failure. In the event of a sin at least 2 dots below the Guardian's present Wisdom score, this entails an automatic loss of Wisdom and the customary subsequent check to resist gaining a derangement.",

In addition to the spells and rotes concealed within The Codex of Lies, the grimoire itself bestows certain interesting benefits upon its possessor. First and foremost, the Codex grants a +1 modifier to all degeneration checks made by its current owner, as well as a +1 modifier to the roll to avoid gaining a derangement in the event of an unsuccessful degeneration check. Whether this is on account of metaphysical proximity to Plures' ideology of eternal sacrifice or some other reason is unknown; some Guardians have spent years researching the seemingly enhanced moral and psychological resiliency of an owner of the Codex, but to no avail. Further, regular study of the Codex grants a Guardian of the Veil (or any that manage to decipher its many tiers of hidden meaning) a +2 modifier to any rolls to influence, infiltrate, or otherwise interact with the structures, policies, and procedures of nearly any Sleeper occult society wholly or partially of Western European origin, with traditions (whether legitimately handed down, pilfered, or acquired by whatever other means) spanning back to at least the early 18th century. This insight is the result of regular perusal and contemplation of the symbolism integrated into the  text, and so functions only for one who has reviewed the grimoire within the past month. This bonus drops to a +1 in dealings with more modern societies deliberately cast in the mold of more antiquated fellowships of this sort, since many of the prominent symbols and ideals of such organizations have entered into the common consciousness and are thus co-opted by such groups."

This spell enables such willworkers to catch fleeting glimpses of the native realities of the ephemeral beings that they call into the Fallen World by studying the immediate history of the Resonance that such creatures carry with them. Success in the casting of this spell grants a willworker insight into the immediate past of an ephemeral entity presently manifested before her or whom she can otherwise perceive. Effectively, the mage begins to \"rewind\" the recent history of the entity, following it back, one minute per turn of concentration and studying the sensory input of its surroundings during that time. The mage may \"pause\" on any given minute and analyze it for content of interest. In the case of a being recently summoned from its home realm, this actually allows the caster to look upon that realm in the time leading up to the summoning. An entity whose existence is only recently established (such as one temporarily created with the Spirit Arcanum), however, may not have much history to study. Likewise, a being summoned from a place in which time has no meaning may reveal nothing, or it may reveal wildly inconclusive information. Following the history of an entity summoned from the Abyss back through the moment of summoning to its place of origin instantly terminates the spell and the mage's player must successfully roll Resolve + Composure, with a dice-pool penalty equal to the Gulmoth's Rank, with failure resulting in a mild derangement (or, if the mage already suffers from a mild derangement, a severe one). At the Storyteller's discretion, a similar effect may befall a willworker using this spell to see back beyond the moment at which an alien entity first arrived in the Fallen World from outside of the Tapestry. Using this spell in an attempt to look past the moment of summoning for a denizen of the Supernal Realms grants a painful and confusing -- and utterly unhelpful -- glimpse of the higher world before abruptly ending the spell. Attempting to look into the Realms Supernal in this way is an act of hubris for any mage with a Wisdom higher than 3, requiring a degeneration roll on two dice.",

Just like scientists can discern the difference between a diamond mined in southern Africa, for instance, and one acquired from elsewhere in the world, an astute willworker can analyze the individual qualities of a particular source of Essence. With a successful casting of this spell, the mage determines the Resonance of a source of Essence, contained within a creature of the appropriate type. With Death 1, the willworker can analyze the Essence inside a ghost, while Life 1 grants insight into points of Essence contained within a living creature (for whatever reason), and Spirit 1, any Essence within a spirit of the Shadow Realm. This spell also gives the caster a rough sense of how much Essence a creature contains. For example, a ghost down to its last two points of Essence reads as nearly depleted, while a powerful denizen of Shadow holding 20 or more points of Essence registers as having a potent stockpile of Essence. This spell also gives a mage a sense for the descriptive qualities of the Essence he sees; knowledge that may, in turn, grant further insight. A perfectly peaceful-looking suburban residence producing Essence flavored by atrocity hides something terrible in its past or its present. Likewise, a seemingly helpful spirit whose Essence resonates with trickery might not be as accommodating as it seems. Any creature that wishes to resist having its Essence scanned resists using its Resistance or Resolve (whichever is applicable). This counts only toward sources of Essence presently contained within the being.

		"Effect" : "The mage can record the secrets of his rotes into a magical book readable by other Awakened minds. Inscribing a grimoire is a bold act, for the mage puts part of his magic into the book by removing it from himself. In doing so, the mage forgets how to cast a rote. He can later re-learn it by studying his own grimoire (or learning from another mage who knows the rote) and with the expenditure of the proper Experience Points, but until he does he cannot cast that rote on his own again (although he can use the grimoire to cast it). Recording would seem at first to be a selfless or foolish thing to do, but orders are hungry for grimoires with which to teach young mages, and pay for them in favors. Also, certain Mind spells or creatures can take knowledge from a mage's mind, leaving a void in its place. In case rotes are lost in this way, it's good to have them \"backed up\" in a book. The spell's target number equals one success per Arcanum dot used in the rote to be recorded. For example, a Life 3, Mind 2 rote requires five successes. The grimoire's Duration is lasting; it cannot be dispelled and does not expire unless the grimoire itself is destroyed. Grimoires allow mages to learn their contents without requiring a teacher, although the experience point cost is the same. Additionally, the mage can cast a grimoire's rotes even if he does not personally know the rotes, as long as he references the book during casting. Doing so requires one turn of reference, during which the mage can do nothing but read the book and move up to his Speed. In the following turn, he can cast the rote. If he is interrupted before casting, he must reference the book all over again. If he already knows the rote, referencing the grimoire gives a +1 bonus to casting it. Grimoires cannot be copied without going through the same spellcasting process used to create them. Only the original is enchanted; mundane copies produce only a mess of meaningless words. Despite the name, grimoires don't have to be books. They can be computer programs or databases, or anything used to store knowledge. Sleepers cannot use grimoires. They cannot make sense of their contents, at least not on the esoteric level required. Only Awakened minds can grasp the lore contained within.",

This is often used to cover one's tracks, to prevent magely detectives from determining where one has been simply by the trace \"dirt\" left on one's aura. The Storyteller rates the strength of the auric marks, generally from 1 to 5, although radical supernatural taint might be rated even higher. This strength must be matched by spellcasting successes for the cleansing to be effective. While one success on the casting of this spell removes any sign of the mark from cursory perception, more intense scrutiny and examination (by others using Mage Sight) will still reveal lingering taint. A Prime 3 version of this spell can be cast upon others.

		"Effect" : "The Templar calls out to seek the audience of an \"angel\" in its literal definition from New Testament Greek as a messenger. The foci for this spell are all three of the hallmark Templar symbols: The Baphomet, the Holy Cross, and a cipher. First, the Templar creates the sign of the Holy Cross on the ground where he wishes to commune with the angel -- the cross in the circle serves as a sort of beacon to the angel in question. Next, the Templar speaks the name of the angel after it has been encoded as a cipher. The more important the \"messenger,\" the more elaborate the cipher must be. Finally, the Templar makes the hand-sign of the Baphomet when the angel arrives, proving to the angel that he is worthy of witnessing the light of God. The Templar casting this spell makes a single call to a single, specific \"messenger\" angel (whose name he may have procured from any number of sources, liturgical or lay, but it must be the angel's true name). The angel who heeds the call (if the spell is successful) is from the loftier regions of the Shadow Realm but has a singular connection to the Aether, or \"Heaven\" as the Templar understands it. Obviously, the \"angel\" is not from the Aether proper, but is savvy to what has occurred there in an up-to-date sense. In the communion with the angel, the Templar may ask the angel any questions that he wishes, and the angel responds with whatever information is salient. Of course, mere men surely cannot grasp the full import of what occurs in the Realms Supernal, and the angel's answers may seem obtuse, incomprehensible, or chaotic. As well, the angel might simply deem the answer to a given question as one the Templar's mind cannot possibly understand, and may deliberately occlude or withhold information (though it will never lie outright). \"What does God look like?\" is not a viable question for this spell to answer, nor is \"What is the meaning of life?\" In response to this first question, the angel might loose a torrent of incomprehensible Enochian syllables, answering the question honestly, but in the language only the angels can understand. The second question might yield an almost rhetorical response, such as, \"To live in righteous imitation of Christ.\" The angels will not be fooled by vain men's attempts to divine the secrets of heaven. Information that may be legitimately gleaned is information that the angel believes men have the context to understand. For example, \"Is God angry that we seek the Ten Commandments\" is a question that would receive a concise answer, while \"How does God feel about our quest for the Ten Commandments\" would elicit either an answer incomprehensible to the Templar or a simple rebuff that \"It is beyond your capacity to know.\" The answers asked of the angels need not always concern the loftier realms. \"Is the Temple Mount the true site of the Temple of Solomon?\" is a fine question to ask (the answer to which depends upon the individual chronicle). So is \"Where have the Templars stored their treasures?\" Indeed, so is, \"Where are my car keys?\" but such a flippant question may well serve to stoke the ire of the angel, and the anger of angels isn't something any mortal is likely to emerge from unchanged. To this end, it's worth noting that summoning the angel in no way offers any protection from it, should its divine graces be mocked, challenged, or denigrated. The Templars believe that the evolution of this spell occurred during New Testament times. They note that Abraham, Isaac, Moses, and other key Biblical figures had to use nothing of the sort to commune with God, while later figures such as Simon Magus had to use the same sorts of formulae that the order itself must. Of course, Simon Magus met his end after challenging God's supremacy, but the Templars are certainly capable of learning from the mistakes of others. Some Templars have taken it upon themselves to learn the celestial speech of the angels, potentially in hopes of tricking the angels to answer their questions with a language they assume the mortals not to comprehend. Again, the angels aren't so simple as this. If an angel suspects a man might have learned the divine tongue, it might simply respond that the answer to a particularly dire question isn't for men to know. And again, attempts at fooling the angels rarely work out well for the would-be trickster. (Of course, that begs the question as to whether a man might even learn the Enochian language, where he'd learn it, and to what end. The occultists John Dee and Edward Kelley claimed to know the speech of Angels, but neither of them is associated with the Templar tradition.)",

If the mage does not (or cannot) spend the Mana, the shield provides no armor against the attacking spell, although the shield remains until its Duration expires, so it can be activated later.

Mages use this spell most often to create a sigil, an image or object that bears their personal mark. Successes are applied to the sigil's Duration. This magical aura does not extinguish the object's own resonance, but the aura does make it harder to scrutinize the object: Anyone studying the object with Mage Sight must first collect a number of successes equal to this spell's Potency before the natural resonance can be discerned past the mage's imposed aura. If this spell is cast as a group ritual, the auras of all the mages involved are imposed upon the target object. In this manner, cabals can mark items with their own group sigil. With Prime 3, the mage can sigilize his aura upon living creatures, covering up their natural auras with his own. Some mages have been known to do this to \"brand\" their servants or even their apprentices. When cast in combination with the Prime 2 Transform Aura effect, this spell can sigilize items with an aura other than the mage's own. It is not easy counterfeiting other mage's auras, however. The mage first has to examine the aura to be copied, using Mage Sight and the rules for scrutinizing resonance. If he's trying to copy a cabal's sigil, he must do this for every aura involved in the sigil. Once he's done this and made the fake sigil, his copy can be scrutinized to see if it's a forgery.

Tales of knights in shining armor, whether among actual military accounts, or even folkloric legends such as Beowulf or the Volsung Saga might have involved kennings related to this spell's function, even though those sources clearly predate the Templar order. While it works fine as a standard armor spell, most mages would likely eschew it as such, since it's not as effective as the armor rotes of many other Arcana (offering less in the way of protection for skilled mages of those Arcana) and it's plainly vulgar.

The mage must be present, within the vicinity of the Hallow's center (five-yard radius per dot). He needs one success per dot rating of the Hallow. The mage's aura cannot conflict with the Hallow's quality of resonance. For example, if his aura is generally angry, he cannot marry a peacefully-aspected Hallow. A dramatic failure at any point during the casting means that the land has rejected the mage. He cannot continue the spell and may not try again for at least a month, during which time he suffers a -2 dice penalty on all spellcasting attempts to channel Mana from that Hallow. Animistic mages believe that the Hallow has a consciousness and it has denied the supplicant; more scientific-minded mages believe that the mage is allergic to something in the Hallow's mystical composition. If the spell succeeds, its effects are lasting - so long as the mage properly maintains a relationship with the Hallow. He must perform at least one oblation per month per dot rating of the Hallow (i.e., a 3-dot Hallow needs three oblations per month), based not on his Path's preferences but on those of the Hallow, determined by its resonance. A resonance of pain or fear might require oblations featuring torture, maiming, or death. Tranquility resonance might need meditative oblations or the tending of a garden within the Hallow's vicinity. Anxiety might be best served through rushed ceremonies and rituals, taut with emotional conflict. The mage - called the spouse - knows which oblations will appease the Hallow. If the mage misses one of these oblations, the spell's effects are dampened temporarily, until he can perform the rite. If more than three months pass without an oblation on the mage's part, the spell expires. That mage cannot attempt to marry the same Hallow again for at least the next three months thereafter. So long as the spell lasts, the mage can choose who can harvest Mana from the Hallow. Mages without permission cannot forcibly harvest the Hallow, except masters with a Prime 5 version of the Channel Mana spell, and, even then, they suffer a dice penalty equal to the spouse's Resolve. With Prime 4, this spell can be cast upon a willing target, bonding her to the Hallow instead of the mage. Only one mage can be bonded to the same Hallow at the same time. For another to bond to it, the current spouse must either cancel his spell or die - or else his Hallow Bond spell can be dispelled.",

Ley energies course unseen and unnoticed by most over the contours of the planet. It is said that the ancients realigned and manipulated such sources of perpetual power. This spell bestows upon the mage a source of perpetual energy, a node from which ley energy wells up. The mage determines the form of the node, whether it is the source of a pure spring, the center of a tranquil valley, or a mountain peak, for example. The effect is lasting -- the energy of the earth replenishes itself, unless something later disrupts the ley lines. Such disruption can be done by altering the architecture or geography of the node, perhaps by simply damming its spring or flooding its valley. The target number depends on how much power the node generates per day. One success makes enough energy per day to power a small room, such as a home office (for its usual day-to-day energy needs in mild temperatures). Three successes can power a small home. Five can power a large home or mansion. Seven successes can power an office building. The power is generated from a single node, so these buildings must have a central hook-up that is placed within the node. For example, a circuit box can be placed in the node, powering anything that leads to it, such as an electrical socket in an upstairs bedroom. This spell does have a couple of drawbacks. First, the mage can create a ley-energy node only at a point at which energies actually converge. Such spots occur at the Storyteller's discretion, but it is said that ancient cultures knew these places. Following old Roman roads or exploring the ruins of ancient villages might lead a mage to such a nexus. Most of the best and most accessible of these junctures have already been claimed. Second, this magic can be dispelled just as any other, causing all that is being powered by the subtle energies to cease functioning until the spell is cast anew (or an alternate power source is arranged).",

(She needs some form of Mage Sight to see it.) If the mage wants to move it laterally, she reaches straight out so that pulling into her body moves the line in the desired direction. If she wants to pull the line closer to the surface, she reaches down toward her feet. Similarly, pulling the line down requires reaching up to the sky. Sleepers would perceive this as extremely odd behavior, but nothing that causes Disbelief. Once she has a grip on the line, she next pulls on the line as if dragging a large steel cable. Onlookers see the mage straining against an invisible resistance. She can drag the line five yards for each success. The spell's target number is thus determined by the total distance the mage wants to move the line. As soon as the mage reaches the desired distance, she must finally anchor the line into its new position by investing one Mana to peg the line down. Imagine a tent spike that keeps a rope in place, and you have an idea what the mystical peg does to the conduit. Once the spell expires, the ley line snaps back into its natural shape.",

This signature lies dormant and cannot be detected by any means until the tass is broken down to be used. Once this occurs, the signature activates and functions as an intimate sympathetic connection to the mage who used the tass to refill her Mana pool. The sympathetic connection persists as long as even one dot of Mana gained from the marked tass remains in the mage's pool. A perceptive mage using Supernal Vision may notice something odd about someone who has absorbed marked Mana. Suspicious mages may roll Resolve + Composure - the Potency of the \"Marked Power\" casting.

As with the Phastasm spell, except that each success grants two dots of Physical Attributes to the phantasm, allocated however the caster wishes, up to a limit of the mage's Prime dots in any one trait. A combined casting with Phantasmal Weapon gives the Marionette more solidity and allows successes to be allocated to an equipment modifier (including weapon damage) or armor. (With Prime 5, the mage doesn't need to combine castings to gain this effect for his Marionette.) When calculating the phantasm's Defense, use its Dexterity or the mage's Wits, whichever is lower. If the phantasm runs out of Health or Structure, it disintegrates back into the Tapestry. The mage must concentrate to direct the phantasm's movements, and he cannot direct it out of the range of his mundane senses, unless he is scrying it with the Space Arcanum (a mage's own phantasms are always treated as Intimately connected for such purposes). While concentrating on moving the phantasm, the mage can still use her Defense, but cannot initiate her own attacks or cast any other magic; her attention is too absorbed.

Sometimes a tulpa becomes wicked or even physically monstrous, but this is the product of flawed discipline on the part of the creator, rather than any fault of the dream-being itself. A tulpa may look like a human being, an animal, a monster, or just about any kind of physiologically plausible being of which the willworker can conceive. Successes are allocated to construct the tulpa's Mental, Physical, and Social Attributes (to a maximum of the mage's Prime dots in any single Attribute; at least one dot must be placed in every Attribute), and extra damage and armor (on a one-for-one basis). The tulpa possesses a Willpower score (the sum of Resolve and Composure as normal) and self-awareness, no matter how rudimentary. Its Size is 5 or less (the caster can decide to make it less than average human Size). The tulpa may be free-willed or bound to the will of the caster, as desired. An especially strong-willed tulpa may defy its binding creator and escape. A physically monstrous or otherwise bizarre tulpa invokes Disbelief when witnessed by Sleepers. Note that at this level of mastery, this spell cannot be given an indefinite Duration (i.e., the tulpa cannot have a \"natural\" life span of human years). The being dissolves when the spell expires. Unless the tulpa created is specifically designed to accept the inevitability of its own demise without emotional trauma, a Wisdom degeneration roll might be required for the caster (unless he has Wisdom 2 or lower). The mage could, however, recast this spell before the previous one expires, giving the tulpa a new Duration. Note that this is an exception to the normal rules for spell control.

Currently active spells register, as do any spells activated during this spell's Duration. As the mage knows constantly where these effects are located, he can try to find them. Locating a specific active spell requires an instant Wits + Occult roll. When a spell the caster has detected ends, he loses his sense of where it was. If he still wishes to navigate toward it, he must do so by memory. This awareness provides only the basic information that a spell is active. In order to learn more about it, the mage must examine it, either in person or through scrying. Additionally, covert magic is significantly more difficult to pinpoint; though the mage can sense it, trying to locate a covert spell well enough to find it applies a -3 dice penalty on the Wits + Occult roll. The mage notices spell effects performed behind wards only if the Potency of his spell exceeds that of the ward. Consider wards to be behind their own shields for the purposes of avoiding detection. Since the spell's range is its primary factor, a mage must choose to increase its Potency specifically if he wants it to bypass any wards.

For each success (or additional Target factor prefigured into the casting), the mage can move one Size point. The maximum Size limit he can move is equal to his Space dots, regardless of successes. The type of thing that can be moved depends on the conjunctional Arcanum used: Matter for objects, Life for living creatures, and Forces for energy.

Once the spell settles over an area, anything that passes through its invisible, intangible barrier during the spell's duration alerts the mage who cast it, no matter where he is. This warning manifests as a slight tingling over the body, a pressure behind the eyes, a momentary case of synesthesia, or several other minute impulses. Mages can, at the time of casting, narrow the spell's definition by declaring some things exempt from notice. The exempt thing may be general (\"insects and rodents\" or \"creatures of Size 2 or less\") or specific (\"one-armed humanoids\" or \"my friend Robert\"), but the spell cannot differentiate based upon anything other than normal sensory input. Choosing to exempt \"my friend Robert\" from the spell draws from the mage's mental imagery to exempt anyone who appears to be Robert; the spell will not note that two people who looked like Robert passed through the barrier at the same time or delve into a person's mind to determine that the person is not actually Robert. Intrusion Warning does not endow the mage with any knowledge of what did pass the boundary (though he'll know it wasn't something he exempted), just that the spell has been breached.

Usually this means small objects, but it could even be used to trace the path of, say, a boulder lobbed at the unlucky mage from a catapult. To determine an object's path, he must have knowledge of where it was at some point during its course. A brief glimpse of the object as it whizzed past is sufficient; alternately, if he can see the object where it landed, he can extrapolate its path back to its origin even if he never saw the object in motion. By adding Time 2 to the casting, the mage can discern the trail of projectiles that moved through an area before he cast the spell. He'll still need some point along its path to work with; usually this means starting at the object's final resting place and working backwards.

Space-based spells (sympathetic magic, scrying, teleportation, and the like) that try to pierce the Ward must exceed the protection's Potency with their own Potency. Each time one of these spells breaches the Ward, it erodes the Ward's Potency by one point, reducing its efficacy. Reinforcing a ward is an exception to the normal spell-control rules. Successive Ward spells add their excess Potency to the Ward (that is, any Potency in excess of the Ward's existing Potency), repairing any damage inflicted, and perhaps even improving upon defenses.

The subject of a Ban can be as general or specific as a mage wishes, ranging from \"all energy\" (meaning that the energy currently within the location remains there and no new energy can enter), to \"thrown rocks\" (meaning that rocks can be carried in, but those thrown at the space are repelled), to \"Jerry's albino boa constrictor, Lucifer\" (which keeps that one snake, and only that snake, out). \"All energy\" might impose a -3 penalty (and require Forces), while \"Jerry's albino boa constrictor, Lucifer\" might invoke no penalty.",

The mage steps forward and \"vanishes\" from one place to arrive at another, \"appearing\" instantaneously. For those who hold to such tales, it is believed that many Awakened survived the fall of Atlantis through use of this spell, opening portals in space to flee to distant sanctums to lick their wounds. Naturally, the wise mage takes some time to scry the layout of the place to which he teleports (even if it is familiar to him), just to be certain that no unwelcome surprises await. The target number is determined by the caster's sympathetic connection to the destination. One person of Size 5 or less can pass through the portal per turn (larger people can spend two turns squeezing through). Each success added to the target number allows the mage to widen the portal so that one additional person can pass through per turn. A Portal's entrance and exit can be placed anywhere that allows a person of Size 5 or less enough freedom of movement to enter or exit it in a single turn. Most Portals are used like doors, with the entrance and exit perpendicular to the ground, but the caster can be creative. The entrance and exit, however, must mirror each other on the same plane. For example, the entrance could be placed below a falling person, but the exit cannot be set to eject the falling person sideways. It must face down (as its opposite faces up). Note that, without applying the Portal Key spell, the caster cannot limit who can use the Portal. Nearby enemies can attempt to step through it, too. A person can be thrown through a portal forcibly. A hold must first be achieved in a grapple action, after which the grappler can shove the person through the Portal as an overpower maneuver. With Space 4, this spell can be cast with a prolonged Duration. With Space 5, it can be cast as an instant action (and with advanced prolonged Duration factors). Cast conjunctionally with Spirit 4, the portal can lead to locations on the other side of the Gauntlet. See the Road Master spell.",

The target number is determined by the caster's sympathetic connection to the most difficult destination to connect to. This spell is an all-or-nothing proposition, with the total number of successes determined by the least-known destination. For example, if the caster is acquainted with two of the destinations but has only encountered the third, he must accrue 12 successes to cast the spell. If he rolls eight successes, and is then halted, the spell doesn't take effect. Each portal of the Arcade spell can accommodate one person of Size 5 or less per turn (larger people can spend two turns squeezing through). Each success added to the target number allows the mage to widen all portals so that one additional person can pass through per turn. All Arcade doorway entrances and exits can be placed anywhere that allows a person of Size 5 or less enough freedom of movement to enter or exit in a single turn. Note that, without applying the Portal Key spell the caster cannot limit who can use the Arcade doorways. Nearby enemies can attempt to step through, too. Additionally, people can be forcibly thrown into any of the doorways as long as a hold is fi rst achieved in a grapple action, after which the grappler can shove the person through a doorway as an overpower maneuver.",

With one success, the spell effects a five-cubic yard area, and can affect a greater area with each additional success; see the Area-Affecting chart. This area is sectioned off into cells by the caster; he can create one division per dot of his Intelligence. Fortunately, this effect cannot cut objects or living things into pieces when it sections them off into cells. It may, however, wreak indirect havoc with people and objects outside of the spell's area, as they no longer have any spatial relationship with objects inside the spell's area. This might cause buildings to lean (but not collapse), vehicles to make strange detours and other chaotic events (most of which are left to player cleverness and Storyteller discretion). A target can leave his or her cell by stepping into another, randomly selected cell, even if it is not geographically contiguous. The caster can designate cells in three dimensions, so that a target may step from ground level to a cell in the air. He will then fall, but he might not suffer injury: As he falls from his cell into another, his destination is again randomly determined; if the new cell is on the ground level, he'll only suffer a short fall of a few feet at best. The targets' movements are not hindered, so he might move through several cells of space in a single turn. In addition, a cell's orientation is randomly shifted, so that a person running forward might suddenly find himself in a cell in which he is running in the opposite or a sideways direction. He can control his orientation and movement within a cell, but has no control over the orientation of his randomly chosen destination cell.

The subject is boxed in and cannot leave under his (or its, in the case of moving objects) own power, detained until such time as the spell expires or the mage chooses to grant release (or someone else with an advanced understanding of spatial magics undoes the imprisonment). From the subject's point of view, no amount of movement in any direction results in progress toward escaping the zone of confinement. Outside observers see the subject moving but not getting anywhere. Although the subject cannot travel anywhere, he still gains his Defense against attacks to which it normally applies. This pocket of \"looped\" spatial strands can be placed directly upon a subject (in which case the subject can contest it with a reflexive Composure + Gnosis roll), or it can be set up so as to snare any who physically enter the space. With a single success, the Suspension snare covers a defined volume of five cubic yards; additional Target factors can increase this volume. The snare does not hold more cubic mass than it is designed to encompass. Made too small, it cannot hold the desired volume. Too large, and it may capture unintended individuals and objects. As the strands close about a living target, he can attempt to slip free in the first turn of contact with a successful Dexterity + Athletics roll as a contested and reflexive action. If his successes exceed the spell's Potency, he slips free of the strands. (If he is a mage, he can attempt to use countermagic instead.) Once suspended, the subject can attempt to wriggle free of the strands with an extended Dexterity + Athletics roll, with rolls once per turn and a target number equal to the Suspension spell's Potency plus its caster's Space dots. Note that a mage with Space 4 can use the Teleportation spell to instantly extricate himself from the strands. In conjunction with Death 2 or Spirit 2, Suspension affects (or can be made to ensnare) Twilight ghosts or spirits, respectively. If such beings have powers that allow them to step across the Gauntlet, they can circumvent Suspension (as can a mage using the Spirit 4 Road Master spell).

This spell enables a mage to create just such a sanctum, spinning complex barriers of space to guard against unwanted intrusion. In effect, the chosen area exists only partway inside the conventional concept of a place, hidden within a convoluted knot of twisted paths through which a would-be visitor must travel in very specific ways. Thus, while logic might dictate that walking straight for a mile from the north bank of the river gets one to a destination, in practice, 10 miles of twists and turns, which seem to lead through much more terrain than could be possible, intervene. Taking any wrong turns waylays the journey, meaning that the traveler must find his way out (by no means a guarantee) and start over. Therefore, unless an individual is extremely lucky, he must know the way to reach his intended destination. Attempting to find the hidden site can be undertaken as an extended Intelligence + Investigation or Survival (whichever Skill is higher) action, with a target number equal to one higher than the spell's Potency and 30 minutes' time spent per roll. Any failure forces the seeker to start over. A dramatic failure gets him lost within the tangle of space surrounding the location, meaning that he must now navigate his way back to square one (a difficult task at best; he must collect the same number of successes that got him there). A person with the Direction Sense Merit is allowed one roll for every 10 minutes spent searching instead of every 30 minutes. The caster can extend the Duration factors of this spell using the advanced prolonged factors.",

The mage is capable of sculpting bizarre vicissitudes of place and distance through this level of Space, folding space in ways that defy the senses. For example, the horror-movie staple of causing every possible path of egress from a given locale to instead lead back to isolated wilderness is possible. So is making a road that a person can visually confirm leads to the store down the street, but traveling that way actually leads in the opposite direction.

The mage could, if he wished, chop a winter's worth of firewood in an hour or so, guard every entrance to a building, or even become a one-man mob. This spell is an advanced version of Co-Location. With the Life 4 version of this spell, the mage's duplicates (one per success) are substantial, but are all extensions of the same physical presence. When one is wounded, for example, all feel pain and suffer Health wounds of damage. (The casting mage himself does not suffer wounds unless he is attacked directly.) Without adding the appropriate level of Mind (1 or 3 for multitasking), these copies do exactly what the mage does and all share in a single Defense (meaning that any attack against any copy causes the Defense of all to erode by the same amount over the course of a turn). It costs one Mana to add multitasking to the spell, regardless of the number of duplicates. With the Life 5 version of the spell, the mage can create distinct clones of himself at different locations, one clone per success and one Mana per clone. Each clone has its own Health and Defense. If a mage wants his duplicates' equipment (items intended to interact with other beings such knives or guns) to be substantial, regardless of which version of the spell is used, Matter 5 must be added to the casting and one Mana per object must be spent (which gives physical substance to each copy of the item possessed by all duplicates). As with the simpler Co-Location spell, the mage's weakest sympathetic connection (the one with the highest spellcasting penalty) is used when casting this spell.",

A willworker armed with this magic need not resort to such indelicate methods. The spell banishes a person into a pocket of looped space in which the victim sees herself reflected, as though in some especially deranged funhouse. Images created through both the Forces and Time Arcana allow her to see herself in various states of disarray: Maddened, starving, dying of self-inflicted wounds, and the like. No matter where she flees, she hears her own voice, screaming at her, and hears what she believes to be her own desperate thoughts, echoing back to her from across gulfs of space and time. Implanted suggestions and false memories make moments feel like days. Needless to say, use of this magic can easily lead a mage astray from the path of Wisdom. During the Duration of this spell, an extended roll (with the same dice pool used to cast the spell) is made for the caster once every 10 minutes, contested reflexively by the victim's Composure + Gnosis. If the caster's successes exceed the target's successes, each excess success causes the target to lose one Willpower point as visions drive her mad. If the victim is reduced to zero Willpower points, she suffers a severe derangement and returns to normal space/time a gibbering wreck, likely capable of little more than curling up in a fetal ball or screaming herself hoarse. After she returns from this imprisonment, she truthfully answers any questions put to her by the spell's caster. If the subject successfully contests a roll made for the mage at any point, she returns to mental reality. She is almost certainly shaken and scared, but is perfectly capable of acting normally.",

While this spell requires a considerable degree of Awakened prowess, Phased Strike ranks among the more elegant solutions to the age-old problem. Upon casting this spell, the Arrow is capable of simply disregarding an enemy's physical armor (that is, armor not granted by a spell of the Practice of Shielding or other directly supernatural form of protection, upon which this spell has no effect), irrespective of its type, provided he himself is wielding a weapon made of inert matter -- the weapon simply passes through the armor as though it wasn't there. This is not an armor-piercing effect. If both the weapon and the armor in question are made of mundane, non-precious materials, Matter 3 is used in the casting of the spell. If the weapon and/or armor in question are made of mundane precious materials, Matter 4 is instead used. And, if the weapon and/or armor in question are made of extraordinary materials, Matter 5 is used.

An SUV can be reduced to the dimensions of a toy car (though it is still a fully functional toy car, which weighs thousands of pounds). Mages who would perform such alterations are advised to remember the way in which these changes can interact with the environment. In the example of the SUV, it's recommended that one not allow the vehicle onto a muddy road (where it will sink like a stone in water due to its immense weight condensed to a tiny surface area). A target made larger through use of this spell is not made heavier; he still might be able to walk across rotting boards or thin ice that might otherwise give way to someone with a larger mass but smaller size. Affecting a base life form requires Life 2, a median life form Life 3, and a human being Life 4. Affecting an object requires Matter 2. A being's species factor is partially based on Size and partially on metabolism -- some creatures are slower than others, even though their large stride would seemingly make them faster (as with giraffes and elephants). Since this spell doesn't alter metabolism, the Size change affects Speed only partially. For every increase of two Size points, add one point of Speed. For every decrease of two Size points, subtract one point of Speed. An average human (Size 5) who becomes Size 7 gets a +1 Speed bonus, while he suffers a -1 Speed if he becomes Size 3.",

		"Effect" : "In one of the most basic spells of Santer&iacute;a, an Awakened santero can call down one of the orishas and allow the deity to possess him. The orisha can then use its powers through the mage's body, dispense godly wisdom or, unfortunately, wreak punishment on anyone who happens to offend it. Although this rite is considered a sacred act as well as a useful practice, santeros do understand that they risk their lives by trucking with the orishas. But, characteristically, they realize that if they should die while being ridden by an orisha, they have become a great ebb&oacute;. Some traditions even hold that if someone dies while being ridden by an orisha, that person can become an orisha. The mage dances a bembe, and he must be accompanied by ritual drums. Often, other santeros dance with him, and this ritual usually follows an ebb&oacute;. The mage continues to dance until his mind and body are overwhelmed by the exertion of the bembe and the drums, and the orisha enters him. In game terms, the player must accumulate a number of successes equal to the mage's Stamina + Resolve, and if the character possesses the Iron Stamina  Merit, those dots are also added to the target number of successes. Each roll equates one minute of dancing, and the player can only make a number of rolls equal to the mage's Stamina + Athletics (after which the mage is too exhausted to dance properly). Once the player has accumulated the proper number of successes, the orisha possesses the mage. At this point, the mage begins to behave like the orisha in question. Osain limps and leans on a walking stick. Chang&oacute; is lusty and belligerent, while Osh&uacute;n is flirtatious. The orishas demand their tribute -- many of them try to take bites of the raw flesh of the ritual sacrifice, and all must have their special foods and items (see Foci), or else they depart and the spell ends. While the mage is being possessed, the orisha speaks and acts through him. The other santeros present can ask the orisha for advice or intercession. If any are Awakened, they can ask the orisha for magical understanding (this can be used to justify an increase in Gnosis or Arcana ratings), even learning rotes from the orisha. Occasionally, a mage channels one of the warlike orishas (Chang&oacute;, Ogg&uacute;n, Eleggu&aacute;, Ochosi, or Oy&aacute;) to help him fight in an upcoming battle. The game effects of this possession vary depending on the Storyteller's decision of what the orishas are and what role they fulfill in the chronicle. In general, this spell allows an effect similar to Coaxing the Spirits (Spirit 1), but with farther-reaching effects. The mage receives a number of bonus dice to a given task based on how satisfied the orisha is with the sacrifice, the items offered to it, and the bembe the mage performed (the Storyteller should take all of this into consideration and then make a roll for the player, probably Manipulation + Socialize, and use the successes for the bonus dice). These dice can be used on any roll that the task involves, but the player does not know how many he has to work with (just as the mage doesn't know how far the orisha's influence will carry him). At some point, the capricious orisha's attention fades, and the mage is on his own again.",

He may either call one or more spirits personally known to him, or he may specify any type of spirit of his choosing (tree spirits or bird spirits, for example), or even send out a general summons to all spirits within his range (by spending one Mana; the closest spirit responds). The spirit comes to the caster with as much speed as it can muster, although it cannot be made to go farther than the maximum distance it is allowed to travel from its anchor. The call may be a gentle request for audience or it may be an irresistible compulsion, at the mage's discretion. Many spirits do not appreciate being called in the latter fashion, though some are too mindless to care and others may actually esteem the mage's boldness in demanding their presence in so unhesitating a manner. A curious spirit usually answers a general call or personal summons, but a reflexive and contested roll is made if it does not wish to respond. This spell does not allow the mage to command the spirit or force it to manifest (see the Spirit 3 Control Spirit spell).

As spirits become more powerful, their bans become more complex and difficult to read. When a mage attempts Read Spirit, the Potency of the casting must exceed the Rank of the spirit in order for any useful information to be learned. Conversely, the more Potent the spell, the more likely it is the spirit will notice the casting. If the spell reaches Potency 3 or more, the spirit is allowed a reflexive Finesse roll, requiring a simple success to sense the attempt to read it.

The spirit must be a willing participant in this transaction. These deals are invariably pre-arranged.

More often, the mage must seek out the spirit and offer a great and onerous service in return for the gift of cheap spell relinquishment. Expect the service to be difficult, dangerous and time-consuming; it will typically comprise a chapter or story unto itself. The quest may take place in Twilight, the Shadow Realm or the Material Realm. Agendas of spirits for the Material Realm are often bafflingly obscure. Spirits who embody a particular concept or sphere of influence often require their mortal negotiating partners to perform acts of symbolic significance, which generate power for them in the Shadow Realm.

				"RoteDescription" : "This rote provides a modern refashioning of the ceremonies at Eleusis, particularly those that initiated a participant into the Eleusinian Mysteries. In the Greek rites of old, the cultists drank from a heady entheogenic brew of what was believed to be barley, water, and pennyroyal (a slightly toxic variety of strong mint). Honey was often added for flavor, and the modern version has it, as well. Some speculate that the entheogen of the brew came from empurpled barley, whose color was granted by the psychoactive ergot fungus that grew upon it. Others believe it the combination of the toxic mint and the fermentation of the brew contributed toward visions. Here, modern participants of this ritual add their own hallucinogen - most prefer to add something natural (mushrooms, extract of ayahuasca, peyote), but some will add synthetics like LSD or lab-DMT to the brew. The drink provides the first focus of the rote, and to a point, the hallucinogen in the drink is the second focus. Participants must gulp, not sip, the brew. The third focus is a copy of one of Homer's books: Likely The Iliad or The Odyssey, though the anonymous (but oft-attributed to him) Homeric Hymns work just as well. The caster must read from random passages from the text. The nature of the passages matters little. The simple repetition of these ancient words is believed to form a conduit between past, present and future through which the gods can travel. (Note that some mages set a conditional duration upon this spell for the sake of safety. That condition is met when the Homeric text is closed. With the clap of the book's closing, the \"god\" is banished.) Note that this rote does not have a condition of environment (it can be performed anywhere, whether in the middle of a circle of stones or in a dark attic strewn with old toys), but it does have a temporal condition. It must be performed at dawn or dusk; at any other time, the rote fails. Improvised casting has no such restrictions."

The pack accepts sophisticated commands because its ruling spirit is intelligent enough to interpret them, but it always resolves ambiguous instructions in a way that would allow the pack to act as it would in nature. Additionally, the mage cannot instruct individual pack members. Instead, she delivers orders to the pack as a whole. The pack spirit uses its own intelligence to carry out commands through pack members, assigning them individual tasks. The mage affects all targets of the same species within a defined area based on the number of successes scored. The spell must affect at least 2 targets or a swarm to work at all. The creatures under her thrall are more competent at instinctual tasks. Each level of Potency adds 1 die (maximum 5) to dice pools associated with these tasks.

This resonance can lead people to believe in more than what their eyes reveal to them; aware, on some deep-seated, instinctual level, that wonders and horrors lurk beyond the limits of mundane perceptions. This spell, however, negates Shadow's rarified leverage over the material realm, significantly reducing its impact upon people and places. When successfully cast, this spell temporarily negates the influence of Shadow upon a physical location within the mage's sensory range. Effectively, the resonance of the area becomes perfectly neutral, exerting no influence over Sleepers, one way or the other, and making the place seem spiritually inert. Mages can discern this unusual \"dead air\" through any of the normal means of perceiving or scrutinizing resonance, and even Sleepers sometimes get a sense that such a place is somehow off; like something brand-new from the store, it has no individual character.

A Numinous Shield requires one Mana each time it contends with an incoming power. If the mage does not (or cannot) allocate the Mana, the shield provides no armor against the attacking power, although the shield remains until its Duration expires, so it can be activated later. Among other things, this spell allows a mage to use a Numinous Shield selectively, blocking hostile powers but allowing friendly powers through.

Only a spirit aligned to the endeavor the mage has in mind (a spirit of violence for a weapon, for instance, one of protection for armor, or one of communication for a cellular phone) can be thus manipulated. For each success accrued in the casting, the item created has a +1 equipment bonus, up to the mage's dots in the Matter Arcanum.

This item has a presence in Twilight and in Shadow, and can be used, without any other effects, to interact with beings or objects in either; armor will guard against attacks originating in Twilight, while a phone can call another phone presently in Shadow (even if said phone would not normally be able to receive calls there).

		"Effect" : "The mage opens a road across the Gauntlet, a lane where he can cross over to the Shadow Realm and where spirits from the Shadow Realm can cross over into the material world (although they are in the state of Twilight unless they can manifest with their own power). The mage cannot stop other beings from using the road unless he works to physically or mystically bar them. In ancient days, it is said, the worlds of spirit and flesh were one and there was no need for such a road. Now, the invisible realms are well hidden from the eyes of ordinary men and only those who understand the secrets of spirits can lower the wall between flesh and spirit. The target number is equal to the local Gauntlet's Strength (minimum one success even with a weak Gauntlet). A dramatic failure on the casting means the mage may not attempt to create a Spirit Road again for another day (24 hours), which may leave him in a precarious position if he's currently in the Shadow Realm trying to get back to the material realm (although he may be brought across by another mage's spell). When stepping from the material realm into the Shadow Realm, the mage appears in the Shadow Realm location contiguous with the place he just left in the material realm. One person or spirit of Size 5 or less can walk the road per turn (larger beings can spend two turns walking it). Each success added to the target number allows the mage to widen the road so that one additional person can walk it per turn. The road remains for one hour. Note that the caster cannot limit who can use the road; nearby enemies can attempt to walk it. A person can be thrown forcibly through the Gauntlet onto the road. He must first be grabbed in a grapple action, after which the grappler can shove him onto the road as an overpower maneuver. With Spirit 4, this spell can be cast with a prolonged Duration. With Spirit 5, it can be cast as an instant action (and with advanced prolonged Duration factors).",

		"Effect" : "Before casting this spell, the mage must locate or summon an appropriate Twilight spirit, and she must be able to see, touch, and communicate with it (usually through the use of other Spirit spells). In most cases, the mage will require a spirit that can manifest in an embodied form to perform its service (typically as a horse, though a camel, a dolphin, or even a motorcycle might be more appropriate in some cases). To acquire the service of an embodied spirit, the mage must achieve four successes. If there's no need for the spirit to be capable of manifesting - if, for instance, the mage is capable of assuming a Twilight state - the target number is reduced to three. Embodied spirits will not lose Essence during the Duration of the spell; they typically move at a speed appropriate for their form, but are not limited by fatigue, hunger, fear of predators, etc. The speed of a spirit in Twilight will depend on its type. A wise mage carefully considers the type of spirit she needs when making her initial search or summons, knowing that the more specific traits she seeks, the harder it may be to find a suitable steed. A spirit that serves once may tell the mage its name, if it's been well treated and/or rewarded, making it easier to find for future castings of this spell. The spell can be cast in conjunction with Fate 2 and Space 2, in which case the spirit's service is deferred until some specific circumstance occurs - typically, when the mage calls out for the spirit - at which point it will arrive on the scene within one turn. This enables the caster to make a quick getaway without needing an extended casing.",

		"Effect" : "The mage invites or compels a spirit to inhabit an object and lend its powers to that object in the form of a fetish. Such beings (for those who care about such things) often wish to be placed within an object somehow appropriate to their nature, and grant use of their Numina to whomever holds the object in question. Thus, a fire-spirit may inhabit a dagger of obsidian, or a healing-spirit could possess a container meant for holding water. The spirit still uses its own Essence to fuel its powers and can lapse into slumber if overtaxed. A spirit forced into a fetish rails to be set free, cries that can be heard by any with active Spirit senses. The spirit must be bound into a material object. The spell's target number equals the spirit's Rank. The mage must first find a suitable spirit, usually by seeking one out, calling out to it, or summoning it from the Shadow Realm. A spirit's suitability depends on what the mage wants the fetish to do. If he wants to shoot fiery arrows at his enemies or simply make a portable heater, he needs a fire spirit. Binding a water spirit does not allow him to ignite his arrows or warm him on cold nights. Finding an appropriate subject often involves researching a spirit to make sure it can do what the mage wants -- or that it can do what it says it can. Study usually involves an occult library or past training on the subject. If the Storyteller feels it necessary, he can require an Intelligence + Academics or Occult roll for the mage to properly identify a suitable spirit. The spirit releases its Numina only upon the fetish's activation; it sleeps the rest of the time. The user must request or command the spirit to act whenever he seeks its power. This is done non-verbally with an instant action Gnosis + Spirit roll. Success allows the mage to use the fetish for the following scene. Failure means the spirit remains asleep. A dramatic failure means the spirit is angered and does not respond for at least the next scene. The spirit's powers do not invoke Paradoxes or Disbelief. Spirits are native to the Fallen World and do not invoke the same reactions as Supernal magic. If a fetish's material object is ever destroyed, the spirit is released and becomes a Twilight being. If it has the proper Numina, it can escape back into the Shadow Realm on its own. Otherwise, it is trapped in Twilight until it can find a Verge or a mage (or other supernatural being) to help it pass over.",

For a mind untempered by exposure to Le Livre Rouge, facing one's foulest desires and inner corruption is unsettling at best. By casting this rote, a mage calls into being a goetic demon of her target, similar to the manner in which the spell Goetic Evocation functions. This spell may be cast at sensory range. The demon is an ephemeral entity that initially exists only in Twilight. The ephemeral demon is Rank 1 and begins play with Essence 4 (10 max). The demon's Attributes are determined by the Attributes of the target. Power is equal to half the target's highest Attribute rating (round up) in either Intelligence, Strength, or Presence. Finesse and Resistance are calculated in the same manner based on Wits, Dexterity, and Manipulation, or Resolve, Stamina and Composure, respectively. The demon possesses Influence: Sin 2 (the Vice of the target) and the Numina: Materialize and Fetter. While in Twilight, the demon lurks nearby the target it was created from and uses its Influence to tempt the target into giving in to her Vice. Each time the target gives in to her Vice she gains no Willpower; instead the demon gains 3 Essence. When the demon reaches full Essence it uses its Materialize Numina to punch through the Gauntlet and its Fetter Numina to anchor itself. If the demon is unable to anchor itself to a Fetter before the duration of this spell ends, it discorporates and is unraveled. If the demon succeeds in anchoring itself to a fetter it begins to Materialize as a near-clone of the target. Close associates of the target may realize the demon isn't who it is mimicking with a single success on a Wits + Empathy roll. While materialized, the demon attempts to cause as much havoc as possible (paying special attention to its target's Vice), before retreating to the area of its fetter. The target of the spell then has to deal with the consequences of the demon's actions, which can range from annoying to deadly serious. Demons can maintain themselves indefinitely in Twilight (long after the duration of the original spell has lapsed) after they succeed at creating a fetter. As a result, the only sure way to be rid of the demon is to destroy its fetter. When the fetter is destroyed, the demon is unraveled just as if it had failed to fetter itself during the initial duration of the spell. If attacked, demons reform after being violently discorporated in the same way as normal spirits.",

Every two additional successes can give the demon one extra Numina. The demon can use its Influence to seduce someone into acting out the demon's Vice (which is not necessarily the victim's own), succumbing to its derangement, or falling prey to its psychological Flaw (depending on the type of demon summoned). If the demon's Vice is the same as the victim's, the victim is not rewarded the usual Willpower point for acting out the Vice -- the demon gets this point instead, although he doesn't have to act out the Vice himself (and hence, doesn't get the blame). The demon follows the mage's orders, although if the mage himself engages his personal Vice, derangement or Flaw while this spell is in effect, the demon is freed from control and turns its attentions to corrupting the mage. Casting this spell is an act of hubris, requiring a mage with a Wisdom higher than 4 dots to make a degeneration roll. The demon's ephemeral form remains for one hour.<BR>",

To do so, the character must speak in the tongue of the dragons (which is one reason that Llana does not allow non-members of the Disciples of the World Dragon to witness this spell in progress). The mage is free to request a specific dragon, but any dragon can use the path thus created. The dragon rides the pathway through the Abyss and into the Fallen World, emerging from the Hallow to speak with the mage. The target number of successes is determined as follows. The base is 10 successes. Add one success for every point of the Hallow's rating below five (so a one-dot Hallow adds four successes to the required total). Add one success if the resonance of the Hallow is directly opposed to the Realm that the mage is trying to reach (Storyteller's discretion). Add one success if the character is trying to call on a specific dragon. Add one success if the dragon in question is unlikely to be found in the Realm that the mage is trying to reach (again, Storyteller's discretion). This spell costs 10 Mana to cast. The mage can draw the Mana from the Hallow, from his own pool, or he can add any Mana he does not wish to pay as successes to the target number. If the spell succeeds, the Hallow splits open and a dragon appears. Thus far, no dragon thus summoned has ever attacked the summoner, though Llana maintains that it could happen if the spell were cast improperly. The dragon can give the character information about whatever topic she might desire, especially news and descriptions of the Supernal Realms, new rotes, or weaknesses and powers of Abyssal creatures. The dragon always tells the cast to \"find the World Dragon,\" however.",

The homunculus gains whatever Mental and Social Skills the Storyteller feels are appropriate for the type of spirit or ghost (if any), along with any Flaws and/or derangements. Any supernatural powers arising from their status as discarnate entities are unavailable to them while in homunculus form. While some ghosts and spirits crave the ability to operate in the Material Realm conveyed by possession of a homunculus form, they generally feel this way because they want to pursue a specific agenda of some kind. Savvy mages should expect the average ghost or spirit to display only minimal loyalty and cooperation, except where their own interests converge with those of the discarnate entities they've gifted with physical forms. The most loyal homunculi created in this manner are generally the ghosts of slain cabal members, who use their flawed new forms to further the collective goals they fought for while alive. The Death version of this spell targets ghosts, while its Spirit equivalent works on spirits. This spell is treated as a finishing spell. Any of the substitute relinquishment costs for Enchanted Items may be applied to it. Similar to a finishing spell, Secret Marriage can't be dispelled, only temporarily suppressed. While suppressed, the entity remains within the homunculus but is unable to animate it in any way, including the use of speech. If this spell is cast with a limited Duration, the ghost or spirit departs the homunculus body when the spell expires.

If creating a spirit, successes buy dots of Rank, Attributes, Influence, and Numina for the being on a one-for-one basis. Similarly, changing a spirit (adding to, altering, or subtracting from its Attributes) requires the mage to devote one success per dot to the trait to be added or changed. A mage cannot create a spirit of a greater Rank than the lesser of his Spirit Arcanum or Gnosis. Nor can he advance an extant spirit beyond such a degree or alter one of a Rank greater than the lesser of his Spirit Arcanum or Gnosis. The mage must be familiar with the powers with which he works. That is, he must have studied a spirit who already has those powers before he can imbue them into a spirit. At the Storyteller's discretion, an occult library might hold enough information to allow a mage an Intelligence + Academics roll to understand the forces before he begins casting.

Spirits of lesser Rank than the mage seek (or may be persuaded) to attach themselves to her court, and she is treated with the respect, honor, and dignity due one of her station. Of course, the mage is expected to uphold the dictates and etiquette of the spirit courts (meaning she had best be thoroughly conversant in them) and may herself be offered a position within the court of a still more powerful entity. When calling, controlling, binding, or otherwise using sympathetic magic upon members of her court, the mage may cast spells as though a spirit were in Intimate sympathetic contact with her, without need of the Space Arcanum. Thus, she can easily heal one of her courtiers, regardless of where it is, but could not cast an offensive spell at other spirits through her subject without an appropriate Space component. Any spiritual alliances the mage makes are rendered null and void when the spell expires (at least, spirits don't uphold their end of any bargains, though many continue to expect the willworker to fulfill her outstanding obligations).

Indeed, in ancient Atlantis, the Ladder to Heaven was constructed for the very purpose of conversing with the powers that moved (and were, in turn moved by) the most expansive processes of the cosmos. The Celestial Ladder is gone, but beings still dwell within the Fallen World possessed of such immense power as to be considered divinities in their own right. Masters of the Spirit Arcanum who wish to have contact with such entities make use of this spell to do so. Successful casting of this spell summons a royal avatar to the mage's location. Because of the transcendent nature of spirits of Rank 6 or greater, no Space Arcanum component is necessary to contact the spirit; it simply knows that it is being contacted and either chooses to extrude an avatar or not. If the spirit is unwilling to speak with the summoner, then the spell automatically fails, regardless of successes accrued and Mana spent. Successes equal to five times the avatar's effective spirit Rank (of 5) are necessary to build the ephemeral shell to be inhabited by a fragment of the royal's consciousness and power. The caster has no control, whatsoever, over the final Traits of the royal avatar; the royal assigns them, instead, according to its wishes. If, at any point, the royal wishes to terminate contact with the summoner, the spell automatically ends, with no roll necessary. Should the royal wish to communicate directly with the willworker, then it may simply shift the totality of its presence to the mage's location, though such is surpassingly rare. Not only do most spirit royals have no inclination to deal so directly with mortals, but the unscheduled arrival of so potent a being can inflict disastrous incidental consequences on the local Shadow and material realms. Further, entities of equal or greater standing to the royal may view such a move as an infringement against territorial boundaries and retaliate accordingly. Casting this spell is an act of hubris, requiring any mage with four or more dots of Wisdom to roll three dice against degeneration.",

If all options are based entirely on the results of random chance, rather than any actor's intention, then the mage gains a rough idea of the odds -- that the guy in the black jacket has the edge in the fight that's about to break out (because his Strength + Brawl dots are higher than his opponents' -- not enough to ensure victory, but enough to make him the odds-on favorite).

Using this spell on unworked natural matter, such as a simple stone, tends to produce a disorienting rush of images as the mage's mind tries to process the sheer onslaught of years bombarding her brain; as such, Time's Mark is much more useful on crafted objects such as works of art or weapons. Using this spell on a book or a piece of paper with writing on it doesn't tell how long ago the words were written (or conceived), only how long ago the book or paper was created. No information about the object or target of this spell is conveyed other than age. This spell can be used to discern how much time has elapsed since a ghost or vampire's death, but requires the mage to have Death 1. If the mage has Time 2, she can cast this spell without use of a conjunctional Arcanum. If the object or being has been artificially aged or its age has been retarded somehow (for instance, a vampire's ghoul doesn't age as long as he continues to drink vampiric blood), this spell detects an anomaly but does not automatically tell the mage how old the being or object is. In this case, the caster can perform an extended scrutiny action, with each roll taking one turn. The number of success required is equal to the target's Resolve (if a living being) or 5 (if an object). The spell's Duration is still concentration, so if the caster is interrupted during this extended examination, the spell expires.",

The Storyteller decides what the future holds for the target, knowing that knowledge of the future is often enough to change that future. A woman who is told she will be a store clerk for the rest of her life might then quit her job to go back to school. Some mages don't even need to cast this spell to effect change. Their reputations for prophecy can be used to make others think they have read the future by means of magic. In this way, a mage might influence a friend's behavior in hopes of turning her toward a more productive life by scaring her with predictions of just where her current path will lead. The same person can be targeted with this spell only once every 24 hours. Any attempts to augur him again before 24 hours have passed reveal meaningless echoes of myriad possible actions the target could take, but with no clue as to which might occur, or which is even more problematic than the others.

Without the use of Space 2, she can do this only for an exact spot in which she was or is. She can look only at what was going on while she was physically present in such a location. Generally speaking, the past is much easier to read than the future (since the past's variables are already locked into place), giving a more-or-less objective view of how things unfolded at a given time, in a given place. The mage declares the time and place that she wishes to view, and casting dice pool is modified by temporal sympathy. Each success allows the mage to view up to one turn of time in that place, beginning at the moment declared during casting (such as \"Midnight on New Years Day, 1999, at Times Square\"). She views events in real time (it takes one turn of current time to review one turn of past time) as if through a camera placed amidst the scene, but she can fast forward and replay any part within the viewing period.

The spell might induce the Banisher to attack the target after a protracted battle, when his Mana and Willpower reserves are depleted.

Some Arrows who are tight with certain mystagogues claim that sparse records exist of an Atlantean diaspora-era archer named Sharmach-il having bent the tides of time to cast dozens of arrows at his enemies in the blink of an eye. Others say that the rote has its origins in a 19th-century Arrow by the shadow name of Six-Gun Kate. Still others maintain that it was a veteran of the Second World War, simply called Sarge, who invented the rote. In the end, though, while they might dispute the circumstances of its genesis, few argue with the magic's effectiveness."

He grabs hold of the threads of time and pulls himself back one turn, allowing him to choose a different approach to a situation (though, from the perspective of all save the willworker himself, this is the first and only time this moment has occurred or will occur). This spell can be cast anytime in the Initiative roster from when the caster performed his action until his place in the roster in the next turn. If the player does not declare this casting before then, the previous turn cannot be replayed. If the casting roll fails, the mage does not rewind time (he essentially spends that turn casting and nothing else). If it succeeds, he rewinds himself through time and can then replay his action from the last turn, changing it however he wants (he might decide not to the open the door that released a spirit guardian, for example). Doing so, of course, might change other characters' actions that occurred after his action in the turn he replays and before he casts this spell. This spell cannot undo any effects the mage suffered the first time he experienced the turn that he replays. If he got shot in that turn, and then casts this spell to replay that action, he still suffers from  the gunshot wound, even though he might decide to dodge in his replay of the turn, causing the bullet to miss him. (And if it does hit him, he suffers a second wound!). This spell does not erase the effects of time on the mage. It merely allows him to step back in the river of time by one turn and replay its flow. Although he cannot reverse any harm he himself has suffered, it can be instrumental in allowing the mage to save the lives of others. Those other than the caster may feel a sense of d&eacute;j&#0224; vu about the situation, but for them the caster's new action is the first and only time this turn has happened or will happen. Participants remember the turn only as it has just been played, not as it was previously played before Shifting Sands altered it. (Unless one of them uses the Temporal Wrinkles spell, in which case he is aware of what happened.) With Time 4, the mage can cast this spell upon others, allowing them to alter their actions when replaying the turn.",

		"Effect" : "This magic removes information about a target from the past, so that the information cannot be detected through temporal senses such as Postcognition (Time 2). The spell has to target a specific person, object, or place. Neither the target nor the world suffers physical or mental change; a person who had a span of her past erased would still remember that time, and so would anyone she was with. By itself, Erase History only blocks attempts to observe through time. Unlike a mere warding spell, however, Erase History actually destroys information about a target's past -- the gap in time can't be broken or bypassed with a stronger spell. Erase History, therefore, offers a perfect defense against magical attempt to probe a target's past -- but any mage must realize something very strange is going on when Postcognition on a person can find no trace of her existence between 10 and 11 o'clock last Tuesday. When most mages use Erase History, the subject's past merely becomes undetectable: Another mage using Postcognition simply can't find the target during that timespan. Doomsday Clocks are worse. They leave gaps in history that inspire horror in Time-sensing mages. Part of the past is gone, leaving a soul-shuddering void. Every memory or record of what (or who) was destroyed is a little Time-Paradox -- one thread of reality pulled out, fraying the whole. Erase History requires a simple success, but the character's dice pool is penalized by the span of time he wants to occlude. Use the Duration chart for Prolonged spells to find the dice penalty. If a character has Time 5, use the Advanced Prolongation chart (so blocking an Indefinite span of time, such as occluding an entire human life or the history of a building, would require Time 5 and a -10 dice penalty). Large or multiple targets can impose further penalties. If a mage wants to block a section of time that itself is far in the past, use the modifiers for sympathetic ties, but for the temporal connection. The less accurately you can define the span of time you want to occlude, the weaker the sympathetic tie will be. For instance, erasing \"Bob's history between 8 and 10 p.m. last Tuesday, when he was at that motel\" would provide a Known connection: You know exactly what time, by clock, calendar, and what the subject was doing. Having an object tied to a specific event in that timespan, such as the wrapper of a cheeseburger Bob ate in the motel room, would raise the connection to Intimate. However, hiding \"Bob's visit to the motel some time last week\" would provide, at most, an Acquainted connection. If you had no idea when Bob might have visited the motel, the connection would be Unknown, and the spell would fail; and, of course, you would need Bob's presence to block that episode in his past, anyway. A mage can also perform Erase History through an Extended casting, and try to accumulate enough successes to erase a span of history from temporal sensing.",

No willworker may have more points of Mana readied for use in this way than she has dots in Fate or Prime, whichever is less. The Mana sent forward is lost from the character's current total and recovered points may not bring her over the normal maximum Mana permitted by her Gnosis.

(Dots cannot be added directly to or subtracted directly from Advantages.) It is as if he had made different choices in the past, leading to different personal results. For example, in his newly rewritten past, a mage went to the gym rather than to the library he actually frequented in his real past, allowing him to shift traits from Mental Attributes to Physical Attributes. Note that changing a number that has derived characteristics (Composure or Stamina, for example) alters any such derived characteristics appropriately (say, Willpower or Health).

The mage \"fixes\" a moment in time when the spell is completed. Thereafter, an invisible, ethereal \"lifeline\" connects the caster to that moment as it moves into the past. At any time thereafter, the mage can choose to return to that moment as an instant action, simply by willing it. This ends the spell as the temporal lifeline \"snaps back\" into the past and disappears. The Mana cost of the temporal lifeline cannot be regained so long as the lifeline exists. The mage returns to the chosen moment and all the intervening \"time\" essentially never happened, although the mage remembers it as though it did. It can be considered a \"possible\" future in that the mage can take actions to change the outcome of events. So, for example, a mage who casts this spell before going into a dangerous ruin, then encounters a deadly trap, can activate the lifeline, returning to the moment before she entered the ruin, and make a different choice (assuming the trap wasn't so sudden and deadly that the mage died instantly before she was able to use the lifeline). Once Temporal Lifeline is cast, a mage can even use spells such as Temporal Pocket and Temporal Stutter to move forward faster in time in order to reach a particular future point, then \"snap back\" to the past using the lifeline. It is impossible for the same caster to fix the \"end point\" at two temporal lifelines closer than 24 hours together or to have more than one temporal lifeline active at a time. Thus, after activating the lifeline and returning to the past, the mage cannot cast this spell again until at least 24 hours later.",

With this spell, the normally autonomic functions are triggered regardless of stimuli, bringing about various physical states that may be incongruous with the outside situation.  Sudden  movement  can  send  adrenaline  jolting through a subject’s veins, eliciting a startle or alert response well before the mind has time to identify the incoming stimuli as a threat or not. Appetizing smells cause the stomach to begin producing extra acids and the salivary glands to start functioning, even if the individual knows that the source of the stimulus is inaccessible. Dark, quiet settings or repetitive gentle motion can trigger a body’s sleep reaction, producing melatonin to lull it into a restful state. These physical reactions are autonomic functions to external or internal stimuli, brought about by neural or chemical reactions without need for thought or emotion. By using Trigger Autonomic Function, the mage is able to trip his target’s body’s functions in 197 Chapter Five: Spells and Artifactssuch a way as to elicit these responses without the need for outside stimuli. With a touch, the mage triggers a chosen body function in the target. Examples include sleep, sneezing, coughing, elimination, arousal/orgasm and “fight or flight.” This reaction is simple, physical and immediate, but with the addition of Time 2, this spell can be used on a delay of up to an hour, allowing the mage to cast it and then remove themselves from the area. Unlike “Trigger the Lizard Brain” (Life 4), this spell triggers only physical (bodily) responses, rather than instinctive emotional reactions. Any living target capable of the chosen body function can be targeted. A guard dog could be put to sleep, a visiting dignitary made to soil themselves, or an attacking werewolf affected with a sneezing fit. Vampires or other undead creatures without autonomic functions are not affected by this spell. Supernatural functions, such as frenzy or Death Rage cannot be triggered by this spell, although successfully causing a “fight or flight” reaction may, at the Storyteller’s discretion, prompt a test for supernatural functions.",

This  spell  provides  an automatic  protection  for  the  mage,  her  laboratory and her companions.  The mage casts this spell in an area around himself. If the mage or anyone or anything within this area is attacked either physically or with magic, the spell activates. Once activated, the spell protects everything within a small radius (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 118) around the mage from harm by slowing down fast-moving objects, damping fires and harmlessly grounding dangerous amounts of electricity. If the mage notices any such danger, she can reflexively spend one point of Mana. Then, for the next turn, nothing in the area can move faster than a brisk walk (Speed 10), and levels of temperature and electricity remain safe for everyone inside this area. However, this spell is only useful on small- to moderate-sized threats. Even if a 20-foot-high, 10-foot-thick stone wall fell on someone fairly slowly, it would still (slowly) crush them. Also, once this turn ends, this protection instantly fades, unless the mage spends another point of Mana. The mage can continue spending Mana until she either runs out or the people inside the area cease being in immediate danger.",

With this spell, the mage can make an object appear to be made of something else, without actually changing the object itself. While the Matter spells that actually transform substance work on different types of substances at different levels, Deceptive Appearance can target any non-living, non-magical substance, regardless of rarity or physical state. This spell can change the appearance of any solid, liquid or gas object to that of any other simple substance of the same state. A complex object can be made to take on the overall appearance of any simple substance, but separate spells must be used to give the appearance of separate substances. Thus, with a single use of this spell, a pistol with a metal barrel and wooden handle might be given the appearance of being crafted entirely of gold. However, to give the pistol the appearance of having a gold barrel and ivory handle, two successful separate spells must be cast. Deceptive Appearance does not change the shape of the object. A glass beer stein may be given the appearance of being made of stone or steel, but it cannot be made to look like a martini glass. Successes are allocated to casting factor (Size). At this level, the mage must touch the substance in order to change its appearance. At Matter 4, Deceptive Appearance can be cast at sensory range and can use advanced prolongation Duration factors. Note: The change granted by Deceptive Appearance is visual only. The spell will not change the actual density, weight, taste, smell or temperature of the substance. Wine that is made to appear to be water will still taste like wine and have its intoxicating effects, while lead that is spelled to look like wood will still sink if placed in water. The addition of Mind 2 to this spell allows a mage to grant a change the perception of taste, smell, weight or temperature.

The number of successes rolled determines the size of the object that the spell can restore. The size of the fragment and the number and distance of the pieces do not matter. As long as the mage is holding a piece of the object large enough to see and feel clearly (at least the size of a lentil or dried pea), she can call the remainder of the pieces of the object and reassemble them so that the object looks as good as when it were newly made. Each success (or additional target factor prefigured into the casting) allows the mage to restore an object of that size; thus, three successes allow a mage to restore an object of up to Size 3. If some pieces no longer exist, then the spell creates new matter to repair the missing portions in a manner similar to the \"Repair Object\" spell. However, at least half of the object must still exist in some form similar to its original state. If more than half of the object was utterly destroyed or transformed, such as metal being melted down or reforged, or wood being burned to fine gray ashes, this spell automatically fails, and the mage knows that the object is lost forever.",

If these raw materials are of approximately the right sort (such as plastic, and bits of various sorts of wire for duplicating a computer) and of at least the same Size, then a single success creates a nearly exact duplicate, and further successes create increasingly perfect duplicates. With two successes, all of the print and images inside a duplicated book are identical to the original, and with three or more successes, the book also possesses exactly the same wear patterns. If the mage wishes to duplicate both a computer and the data on it, or to duplicate any other form of electronic storage, then she must cast this as a conjunctional spell with Forces 2. Also, the maximum Size of the object being duplicated equals the mage's dots in Matter. One unusual property of the spell is that if the raw materials are sufficiently close to the object being duplicated, then the Duration of the spell becomes lasting. Examples of these sorts of raw materials are duplicating a book by using a blank book of a similar size and shape and a quantity of ink as raw materials or duplicating a computer by using as raw materials another similar computer (which might be a considerably older model). To create a lasting duplicate, the raw material must be quite similar in both composition and form to the object being duplicated. This spell can also be used to duplicate Artifacts, enhanced, and imbued items if cast as a conjunctional spell with Prime 3; however, duplicates of Artifacts or imbued items made with this spell all have a maximum Duration of 24 hours and can never be made lasting, regardless of the raw materials or power level involved.

Should such a subject fall prey to dementia or brain damage, forgetting even his own name, he will never forget the ideas burned into the deepest recesses of his psyche.

The presence of bystanders has no effect on the magic, though the speech must be targeted specifically at an individual rather than being a general address. If the spell succeeds, the subject never forgets that information without the interference of other magic or powers. Mind 2 is required for the mage to target himself; scribing other minds requires Mind 3. With an additional dot of Mind beyond these requirements, knowledge may be imparted telepathically rather than aloud. Resolve is not subtracted from the caster's pool if the target is aware and willing. Although not widely known outside of the forbidden ranks of the Unforgotten Scions, this spell can also be cast more aggressively on a Sleeper target, in which case the spell costs one Mana point. If the spell succeeds, the target not only remembers the branded information forever but also develops a perverse fascination to share the knowledge with others per the Fixation derangement; this derangement potentially flares up whenever the subject of the information comes up in conversation or the target is actively reminded of it, promoting the usual Resolve + Composure roll to resist. Any new fixation implanted this way replaces all existing ones, so a victim only needs to worry about the most recent obsession. Furthermore, he may permanently overcome such madness by spending one dot of Willpower or raising his Morality; otherwise, such madness is permanent. Damaging a Sleeper's mind this way is an act of hubris, requiring a mage with a Wisdom higher than four dots to make a degeneration roll.

The result is typically mind-numbing terror, as the consciousness recoils from concepts and vistas it was truly not meant to encompass. If the caster accrues more successes than the subject, the target loses a point of Willpower. She also loses her action for that turn, as her mind reels from terror. This spell may also be cast as through extended spellcasting. Unless the Fang has some way to keep the subject in sight for perhaps hours, the extended version of the spell requires a sympathetic tie to the victim. (The character therefore needs Space 2 and the Mind component rises to 5, since the spell directly affects the target.) At each increment of the spell, the character's player rolls Mind + Gnosis against the target's reflexive roll of Composure + Gnosis. If the Fang can accumulate more successes than the target's Willpower before the end of the spellcasting, the subject loses all points of Willpower and collapses in a heap (losing her action for the turn) images of unearthly terror overwhelm her mind. For the rest of the scene, the subject may defend herself (at her full normal Defense, and she may take dodge actions) and can, after her one turn of inactivity, take any action that does not involve directly confronting the caster. When the subject first recovers Willpower (by whatever means) after that scene, she must make a Resolve + Composure roll. Failure results in a temporary mild derangement or, if she already has at least one derangement, a severe one. The use of this spell by a character with a Wisdom of 4 or greater requires a degeneration roll.",

In effect, whoever wields the imbued item gains the benefits of its spells, even though he did not necessarily cast them. The target number is equal to the successes required for all the spells imbued into the item. The mage must be able to cast each spell he wants to imbue, and each spell's target number is determined as if he were casting that spell as an extended action. The target numbers of all spells to be imbued are combined to find the successes needed for the Imbue Item casting. Each spell remains imbued for as long as its Duration. Most imbued items are made with spells of indefinite Duration, and the caster usually relinquishes such an item from his control so it no longer applies to his maximum spell limit. Doing so costs one Willpower dot. One Mana point must be spent per spell imbued, in addition to any Mana normally required for the casting of each spell. The caster decides whether each spell imbued into the item is persistent (always active) or contingent (triggered by a word, gesture, or condition). Even contingent spells imbued into an item must be made indefinite, or they disappear from the item when their Duration expires. The caster can give the item the capacity to hold Mana points. Doing so requires three successes and the item has a capacity of 10 points plus one per spell imbued. Mana must be spent for the caster to actually fill the capacity of points, or else someone with the Channel Mana spell can do so later. The aspect of casting (covert or vulgar) depends on the spells imbued into the item. If the item is imbued with vulgar spells, it risks a Paradox whenever these powers are used. The Paradox dice pool is based on the Gnosis of the imbued item's creator at the time of the item's creation (if his Gnosis later rises, the item's Paradox dice pool does not also rise).",

Because of this limitation, the item is automatically convincing, since it physically duplicates the original object's external properties in every detail, down to the last nick, scratch, marking and resonance imprint. This makes books and other forms of writing particularly attractive targets for the spell, allowing a mage to peruse the contents of manuscripts otherwise lost to time. Once the spell's Duration elapses, the object dissolves back into the flow of continuity. With Prime 4, mages can summon more durable and mechanically functional constructs per the Phantasmal Weapon spell, though such objects cannot have any properties superior to the original object. Therefore, these items are more limited than conventional phantasms, though there is a certain hubristic panache to stabbing someone with Brutus's knife still hot with Caesar's blood instead of wielding a plain dagger.",

A single success temporarily removes one die from the dice pools of a contingent effect. If the number of successes equals or exceeds the number of dots of the highest Arcanum used in this power, then this spell temporarily renders this power unusable. For example, rolling three successes causes an item imbued with a single Life 3 effect to be temporarily non-magical. Persistent items are unaffected by any number of successes less than the number sufficient to completely suppress it. This spell can suppress the powers of an Artifact, but in all cases, powers on an Artifact require one additional success to suppress with this spell; suppressing a Life 3 spell on an Artifact would require the mage to roll four successes. Repeated castings of this spell are not cumulative, but the caster can repeatedly attempt to suppress a single effect by making an especially good roll. Also, mages can cast this spell repeatedly on an item imbued with multiple powers in order to suppress each of these powers in turn.

If the mage also casts the Spirit 2 spell Peer Across the Gauntlet, she can also use the Analyze Spirit spell to analyze nearby spirits in the Shadow Realm. A single success on this spell allows the mage to determine a spirit's Rank and most significant Influence, and also provides a rough estimate of the spirit's current Essence as well as the spirit's general appearance. Additional successes provide further information, including an increasingly precise knowledge of the spirit's Attributes, additional Influences, the level of its various Influences and (with three or more successes) knowledge of its more significant or powerful Numina. This spell provides no knowledge about the activities or history of a particular spirit, merely its capabilities. If the caster adds Mind 1 to the casting, she can also use this spell to gain information about individuals who are mentally projecting, and if she adds Death 1, she can gain similar information about ghosts.",

		"Effect" : "The mage can determine exactly when an object or living being attained its current form. This spell reveals when an object was made, when a raw gemstone was cut or a hunk of ore was mined, when a person or animal was born or when a body or fragment of bone died. Including Life 1 or Matter 1 reveals the date of the other major changes the person or object underwent -- allowing a mage who finds a human skull to determine when the skull's owner was born and when he died, or holding a knife, and knowing when it was made and when the ore it was made from was mined. Also, if combined with Forces 1, this spell can be used to determine the last time a piece of electrically powered or electronic equipment was used or when a computer file was created or edited. For objects more than a decade old, a single success on this roll allows the mage to know the date within a month. For more recent objects, one success determines the date within a day. Each additional success narrows the time down further, in the progression listed below. If the object reached its final state very recently, then use the time listed below that as the starting point for the chart. For example, if someone died within the past hour, then one success allows the time of death to be dated to the correct minute, and two successes allow the time of death to be dated to the correct second.",

This spell is also a swift and useful method of determining if a potentially interesting site is worth pursuing or if it is more recent, and therefore less interesting, than it looks."

(If cast over an area, only people or objects that are wholly within the defined area are affected.) Onlookers simply see those affected disappear for up to several seconds, while those affected lurch forward in time (to find whatever changes having occurred outside of the spell's area of effect during those seconds). Thus, reinforcements three turns away might, in the subjective time of those affected by the spell, arrive in one. If, in the intervening turns, a person or object moves into the space occupied by one or more of the time-stuttering targets, a clash ensues when the time travelers arrive back in their places. Compare the Size of each person or thing who now shares the same space. Those with the smallest Size suffer a knockdown effect. If Sizes are equal, both must contend with a knockdown.",

Mages of the Adamantine Arrow have been known to use this very same rote in combat (perhaps vanishing into the immediate future just before an explosion and then reappearing seconds afterward)."

Thus, the tales of men who bedded down in mushroom rings, only to wake a century later or the next morning, as bent and hobbling ancients. This spell mimics such faerie enchantments, allowing a mage to push a place outside of the normal flow of time so that those within experience a lot of subjective time in a very short period of \"mainstream\" time, or vice-versa. This spell acts like the Temporal Pocket spell, except that the mage can now cast it upon an area. One success affects a five-foot square area and anything within it, and additional Target factors can be devoted to increasing this area. The flow of time can also be reversed so that time within the Pocket moves more slowly than time without. For example, with one success the time within the pocket moves at half the rate as time without: One turn within for every two turns without. With three successes, four turns pass within for every one turn that passes without. A person who enters the area must succeed in a reflexive and contested Composure + Gnosis roll or be caught within the time flux.",
