				"Text" : "The Acanthus of the Adamantine Arrow are tacticians first and last, a natural extension of their prowess with analyzing probability and causality. Thus, they know that mages are in a treacherous position by dint of their numbers. The Awakened are rare, and it’s only because of their penchant for remaining hidden (and their power, obviously) that they survive. But what happens when the Seers of the Throne or Banishers, or some more esoteric enemy, attack and kill the Wise of a given area? The survivors have no way to shore up their numbers. They can’t make more mages. The mages of the Awakening Gambit beg to differ. By analysis and careful manipulation, they say, it is possible to arrange a scenario in which a person must either Awaken or perish. These “Kingmakers” step in only if the target seems to be leaning more toward the “perish” option, but otherwise they welcome a new mage, a mage who is already suited by the circumstances of his Awakening to join the Arrow. Obviously, this position is controversial. Manipulating a mortal’s fate this way can legitimately be viewed as a violation of the Lex Magica, and certainly as an act of hubris. Also, some mages see the Gambit’s strategy as trying to “cheat the system,” arranging false crises so that a mage’s soul is tricked into waking up. What kinds of mages are created from such situations, they wonder? Are these mages dishonest, perhaps with a penchant for underhanded manipulation themselves? Are the Kingmakers, in fact, making more mages like them? Other mages, though, see the Kingmakers’ actions as perfectly viable. The Fallen World isn’t a product of magic, after all; it’s a product of the war between the Exarchs and the Oracles. Clearly, laws for Awakening exist, so why not exploit them? The concern isn’t one of ethics, but of efficacy — do the Gambit’s tactics work? Whether or not they do (see the sidebar), the Awakening Gambit Legacy is tolerated and not viewed as left-handed for two reasons. First, the Kingmakers are planners and logicians without peer — they have to be, to do what they do — and that’s good for the order. Second, the Kingmakers have a reputation within the order as being good judges of character and highly moral in their own right (with respect to matters other than arranging people’s fates like pawns on a chessboard, that is). If the Gambit has an agenda beyond their stated one, they hide it extremely well."
			}, {
				"Title" : "So, Does It Work?",
				"Text" : "The data are inconclusive. It might work. Mages do seem to arise from the situations that the Gambit creates. But even then, are the Kingmakers putting people in situations in which they Awaken, or just choosing people who would have Awakened anyway and acting as the catalyst? Since conclusive data on the number of people who Awaken and under what circumstances aren’t really available, it’s hard to say if the Kingmakers’ actions really have the effect they want. For purposes of your chronicle, the Storyteller doesn’t necessarily need to decide whether the Kingmakers’ methods work consistently. All she needs to decide is whether they work in any particular instance. The players — and their characters — can draw their own conclusions from there."
			}, {
				"Title" : "The World as a Chessboard",
				"Text" : "The Awakening Gambit takes much of its inspiration, even its name, from the game of chess. Almost all members of the Legacy are avid players (and many also partake of other strategy games, such as Go and mah jong). In chess, the “gambit” is an opening strategy, one that usually involves a sacrifice for better position. The Kingmakers see what they do as a sacrifice — they are giving up their own time, their resources and, in some cases, their Wisdom (depending on their methods) for the chance to bring new mages into the fold. Chess terminology permeates the Legacy, and the extended metaphor serves as the method for teaching new members. To the Gambit, the ability to keep a given strategy in mind while also looking after a score of pieces is paramount, because it is with just such complicated stratagems that they seek to Awaken new mages."
			}, {
				"Title" : "The Making of Kings",
				"Text" : "How do the Kingmakers go about arranging Awakenings? The process is a difficult one, and it’s by no means something the Kingmakers do constantly. They recognize that manipulating Destiny this way is dangerous, and so it’s usually only something they attempt when the numbers of mages in the area have fallen for some reason, or when the Arrow is expecting trouble in the near future. But the Gambit mages (sometimes in conjunction with Mysterium or Guardian cabals) keep tabs on Sleepers who would make good mages, and create several scenarios in which the Kingmakers couldarrange an Middlegame (see below) should it become necessary. The Kingmakers structure their scenarios on the game of chess. In the Opening, the Kingmakers choose their target and learn everything they can about her. Each Kingmaker has his own criteria for choosing, rejecting or accepting a potential mage. Some Kingmakers assume that people with families make the best mages, while other Kingmakers won’t even consider Sleepers with such firmly established ties to the mundane world. A Gambit mage might delve into a Sleeper’s family tree, looking for mages, while another looks only at her immediate circle of family and friends, searching for hints of the supernatural. A crucial part of the Opening is exposure to magic. It’s a violation of the Lex Magica, yes, but the Gambit considers it paramount to test the target’s reaction to vulgar magic. The Kingmaker usually brings another member of the Legacy (or his cabal, if the members are sympathetic) to keep things from getting out of control, and chooses a vulgar spell that’s obviously magical but that isn’t going to kill anyone if it misfires (unless the Kingmaker is cocksure, which happens). The usual response is Disbelief, and the Gambit doesn’t consider anything wrong with that. Sometimes, though, a target meets vulgar magic with a different reaction — anger, curiosity, fear — and holds on to that feeling even after the memory has faded. Occasionally, the target seems to “feel” the magic coming before the spell goes off (in game terms, the mortal has the Unseen Sense Merit). Any abnormality is note and interpreted, but whether it cements the decision to continue the Gambit or is viewed as a “deal-breaker” depends on the mage in question. Once the mage feels that he has enough information on the target (which can take months or more), he makes a decision: to press on with the Gambit, to reject the Sleeper outright or to “shelve” the Sleeper against a time when she might be more suitable to the Gambit (or the Gambit has need of her). If the mage decides to press on, the Gambit enters the Middlegame. In this stage, the Kingmaker crafts a scenario precisely designed to play to the person’s strengths and weaknesses in an attempt to back the target into a corner. The target, ideally, has only two choices: Awaken or die. The Middlegame always involves some crisis, but the varieties are limitless. Some Kingmakers prefer to isolate their targets, because it’s easier to arrange things without too many other conflicting factors. Others feel that having large numbers of Sleepers around makes for more powerful and capable mages should the Awakening “take.” The Awakening Gambit views Sleepers involved in a target’s Middlegame as “pawns.” Sleepwalkers are called “bishops” or “rooks” depending on what role they are to play, while mages (or other supernatural beings) who are unaware of what’s going on are called “knights.” A mage (or, potentially, another supernatural being) who isaware of the Kingmaker’s plan and is willingly helping is a “queen.” The “king,” of course, is the target herself. These terms are just shorthand that the Kingmakers use when setting up the scenario. Once the mage figures out exactly what role a given “piece” needs to play, he refers to her by a name rather than the title. The Middlegame is planned as meticulously as possible, leaving as little to chance as the Kingmaker can manage. Mages with proficiency in Mind as well as Fate often do a “dry run” in their own dreams, trying to account for the variables of the situation and identify any variables that they are missing. In the end, though, it’s impossible to take everything into account, and so expecting the unexpected is crucial to the Kingmakers’ work. One facet of the Gambit that the mage always spends time on is the Failsafe. The Failsafe is the mage’s strategy for extraction — saving the Sleeper’s life should she fail to Awaken or otherwise save herself. This might involve setting up a portal with the Space Arcanum or preparing a powerful healing spell (or both), depending on the capabilities of the mage and what he expects to happen. Before putting the Middlegame into effect, the Kingmaker and any knowing allies he enlists spend time in meditation before beginning. This meditation is meant to put the Kingmaker’s intentions in the right place, and hopefully ensure that they will have the purity of heart to see it through (see p. 51 of the World of Darkness Rulebookfor more on meditation and its game effects). When the Middlegame begins, the rest is in the target’s hands. The resolution — the Endgame — is one of three possibilities. The simplest is that something goes wrong, some unforeseen occurrence that the mage cannot control or mitigate. The mage aborts and takes the Middlegame back to the drawing board (and always spends time in deep analysis to make sure that whatever interfered wasn’t the result of someone else, such as the Seers of the Throne, taking a hand). The desirable outcome, of course, is for the target to Awaken. In this case, the mage allows the target to handle as much of the crisis as she can, but does step in to prevent death and destruction as necessary. The new mage is then welcomed to the Awakened community, and is expected (though not technically required) to join the Adamantine Arrow. Finally, the target might fail to Awaken. The Failsafe is put into effect, and hopefully the Kingmaker saves the Sleeper’s life and the lives of those around her. The target is watched sporadically afterwards, in case she should Awaken later, but for the most part, the experience is chalked up to learning, and the Kingmaker looks for a new potential mage."

				"Text" : "A single father of two comes to the attention of a Kingmaker, who feels that despite his heavy responsibilities (or rather, because of them) he would make a good recruit. Since the focus of his life is his children, the Kingmaker decides to use them in the Middlegame. He entices the kids to get on the wrong bus one day on the way home, and watches the man’s panic as he can’t find his children. He does the sensible thing — notify the police — but that’s not enough for him. He starts an in-depth search of the area where his kids were last seen, talks to people, pays for information from some passersby and works his way closer to his kids. The children, meanwhile, have been shunted from place to place all day courtesy of the Kingmaker’s magic (but kept safe all the while). The Middlegame is a race — can the man get his kids back before they step off the last bus, miles away from anywhere they recognize? The father finds himself wandering amidst a gleaming set of iron towers, but can see the threads that lead him directly through the maze to what he loves most, his family. He Awakens as a Mastigos, and the Kingmaker is there to welcome the new mage. An EMT has been taking note of odd emergencies in the city for some time, but does not realize they are largely the result of extended conflict between warring Awakened factions. The Kingmakers, hurting from a recent assault from the Seers of the Throne, decide to try to Awaken her. Calling upon intelligence about the Seers, the Kingmakers arrange to attack a lone (but powerful) enemy, and influence a Sleeper witness to call for an ambulance. The EMT arrives and witnesses the Kingmaker and the Seer casting spells, but is unable to resist the Disbelief — instead, she “merely” does her job, patching up the wounded. She demonstrates courage in the face of danger but does not Awaken. The Kingmakers might consider making an ally of her in another capacity, but they write off this Middlegame as a failure. A Sleeper occultist has amassed a collection of magical tomes, and has cross-referenced the information there well enough to see some Supernal correspondences. The Kingmakers figure that it’s only a matter of time until he Awakens anyway, and decide to give him a boost. They arrange for him to be invited to an auction at which several rare books are being sold, one of which is a “plant,” created by an allied cabal and containing dangerous spirit-summoning spells. When the auctioneer opens the book, the spirits are released and run amok (but are not powerful enough to do anything but frighten people). The occultist hides under a table, whimpering, and the Kingmakers put the Failsafe into effect — speaking a trigger phrase, they banish the spirits and wait for Disbelief to kick in. They might later “liberate” a few of the occult books from this man’s collection, since he’s obviously not going to be using them anytime soon."

The Mysterium regards the Gambit as a fascinating experiment, and potentially enlightening about the nature of the Awakening. Therefore, Mysterium mages often wind up as queens or rooks in the Gambit’s endeavors, provided they are allowed the chance to interview any successfully Awakened targets. The Silver Ladder and the Free Council, perhaps surprisingly, have similar reactions to the Gambit. Namely, they either applaud the Legacy’s efforts in trying to codify the Awakening, or they damn the Kingmakers as meddlers and manipulators. Often, whichever attitude one order takes, the other order takes the opposite. The Guardians of the Veil, of course, take an extremely dim view of the Awakening Gambit. People Awaken when they are meant to, and forcing the issue doesn’t lead to anything but risk for all involved. It is rumored, though, that the Guardians teach an analogous Legacy to their own Tricksters, and that their gambits are subtle enough to put those of the Arrow to shame. Indeed, Arrows of the Legacy sometimes joke that the whole Awakening Gambit is merely part of a larger Middlegame dreamed up by the Guardians."

The Acanthus who go on to the Gambit tend to worry about the numbers of the Awakened and are frustrated by the inability to decide who becomes a mage. This isn’t necessarily out of egomania; more than one Kingmaker has made a friend of a courageous, honest and forthright Sleeper and wished desperately to be able to bring him into the fold as one of the Wise, for his own benefit and that of the Consilium. Young and inexperienced mages aren’t usually told about the Gambit, and even if they learn about it, they aren’t usually afforded the chance to join. Aside from the fairly stringent magical requirements (see “Attainments”), the kind of work that the Kingmakers do is based on life experience and, more specifically, life experience as a mage. Until an Arrow has a few years with a cabal under her belt, dealing directly with other mages and seeing the kinds of qualities that go into being successful among the Awakened, she probably has no business with the Gambit."

The Middlegame is much easier to arrange and execute with assistance, and so when a Kingmaker takes a pupil, she usually does so with the assumption that the pupil is going to stay in the area and help her. It’s also not uncommon for Kingmakers to receive requests from nearby cities (and “nearby” is relative) to come and assist with a Gambit, so the Legacy’s members keep informal contact with each other. All Kingmakers are expected to be active members of the Adamantine Arrow. Loners and curmudgeons need not apply — the Awakening Gambit isn’t necessarily friendly, but it is social. Teachers and pupils often live together during the initial training sessions, and even after the pupil has officially joined the Legacy, his lessons in evaluating Sleepers and constructing the Middlegame continue. The Legacy is therefore a tight-knit fraternity (one of the reasons that it survives despite concerns about its ethics and efficacy)."

This is called moving en passantor “in passing.” A given pawn can do this only on its first move, and the move places it in danger. Mages, Acanthus especially, have a kind of en passant move for their magic — the conditional trigger. By hanging a spell and attaching a trigger to it, a mage can “store” a spell for a given period of time (this is described on p. 150 and p. 260 of Mage: The Awakening). Mages of the Awakening Gambit can more easily “hang” spells, which is quite useful for situations such as the Middlegame when casting spells quickly becomes paramount. A Kingmaker can hang a number of spells equal to his Gnosis. The player suffers no dice penalty when casting these spells and no Mana is required beyond what the spells in question would normally cost, but the spells remain in place for four hours only. The Kingmaker’s Mind magic allows a split in concentration that permits these spells to be cast, then “forgotten” until they are needed. These spells do not count against the mage’s total of active spells, and they do not count for purposes of Spell Tolerance (see p. 75 and p. 128, respectively, of Mage: The Awakening)."

				"Description" : "In chess, a “mysterious rook” move is a move with the rook that seems to have no immediate purpose but that discourages an opponent from taking a given action or begins a much more subtle plan of attack. The Awakening Gambit’s second Attainment allows the mage to instill feelings and compulsions in others with a glance, useful for discouraging unwanted attention or steering pawns in the proper direction. The Attainment is similar to the Mind spell “Emotional Urging,” but is more potent. The player spends a point of Mana. The mage need only be able to see the target. The emotion that the mage attempts to inflict must make some logical sense given the scenario. During a bank robbery, a mage would not be able to use this Attainment to instill feelings of deep love and commitment from a teller to the thief (unless the mage happens to know that this particular teller hasthe predilection for such feelings — and the Kingmakers do indeed take the time to learn as much as they can about potential bystanders to the Middlegame, for precisely this reason). If the target is a Sleeper andthe mage is not attempting to influence behavior directly, no dice roll is required. What effect this has on the target’s behavior is largely a matter for the Storyteller (probably with input from the player), but the Kingmakers usually use this Attainment to clear away uninvolved parties or to nudge pawns in the appropriate directions. A sudden compulsion to get a cheeseburger can make a pawn turn left (toward the restaurant) at the corner, instead of right, and that might make all the difference. When this Attainment is used against mages or other supernatural beings, or when the mage tries to influence behavior more directly, the player must roll Manipulation + Persuasion + Mind (minus the target’s Resolve + Gnosis). If this roll succeeds, the mage can implant a single, one-phrase suggestion (for a Sleeper) or affect the target’s emotions as described above (for supernatural beings). The point of Mana is still required, however. Optional Arcanum: Time 3 A Kingmaker who is also a Disciple of Time has some recourse even if something goes wrong during the Middlegame. This effect is similar to the Time 3 spell “Shifting Sands,” and allows the mage to rewind time back to his last action. From there, the mage can take a different action and hopefully avoid whatever unpleasantness time has in store for him (but all else being equal, the other people involved still take the same actions, so he needs to make his action count). The player simply spends a point of Mana to activate the effect. Using this Attainment more than once on the same action (that is, rewinding time more than once trying to get the desired result) is possible, but expensive — the Mana cost increases by 1 each time. The second time the mage rewinds time for the same action, it costs two Mana, then three and so on."

				"Description" : "Sometimes it’s impossible for even the careful Kingmakers to keep track of everything they need to during a Middlegame. The most powerful, however, seem to be working on dozens of possibilities at once, keeping multiple dangers from becoming catastrophes and waiting for the perfect moment to begin the Endgame. Grandmaster’s View allows this kind of precision. This Attainment is somewhat similar to the Mind 4 spell “Supreme Augmentation” (p. 216 of Mage: The Awakening), but it does not by itself allow the mage to raise Attributes. Instead, it provides a kind of mental simulator, allowing the mage to consider the ramifications of his actions before he takes them. In game terms, the mage is always considered to have the highest initiative in a conflict, his Defense does not decrease due to attacks from multiple opponents (see p. 156 of the World of Darkness Rulebook) and he applies his Defense against all ranged attacks. Outside combat, though, the mage can also take advantage of the Attainment. He can take up to four non-Physical actions in a single turn. For instance, he can try to remember a fact, plan a route through the city, read a book and listen for an approaching car at the same time. He must be physically capable of performing both actions at once — that is, if he’s already explaining a concept to someone, he can’t be simultaneously trying to persuade someone else to help him. If the mage is called upon to take a Physical action, he cannot make use of this facet of the Attainment during that turn, however. Optional Arcanum: Time 4 If the Kingmaker is also an Adept of Time, he can move from simulating the future to experiencing it — up to a point. The player spends one point of Mana and rolls Intelligence + Wits + Time. If this roll succeeds, the mage chooses a number of actions equal to his Time dots, and can try them out in succession. This Attainment works in or out of combat, but determining causality is more difficult the more time elapses from his action. Also, keeping control of the time stream grows progressively difficult. For every action the mage undertakes, the player must roll Resolve + Composure. If this roll succeeds, the mage maintains control and can simply observe what future this action leads to. If this roll fails, though, the mage’s focus slips, and the action he’s currently view actually happens, becoming reality. The mage can tryto pull it back using the second Attainment’s optional Arcanum power, but doing so requires a roll of Manipulation + Wits with a negative modifier equal to the number of actions that the mage has already viewed. Example: A Middlegame has become rather more violent than Fisher was expecting. The target is surrounded by thugs, several of whom are pawns of a local vampire lord, and Fisher knows that if he doesn’t step in, his target is going to die. Fisher activates his Attainment and chooses four actions (since Fisher is an Adept of Time). For the first possibility, Fisher casts Chronos’s Curse on the thugs, hoping to slow them enough for his target to escape. The player makes the roll for the spell, Paradox and all, and it turns out that this spell fails — obviously that’s not a good option. The player rolls Resolve + Composure and succeeds, so Fisher can continue looking. For the second possibility, Fisher shoots one of the thugs in the leg and yells for the others to stand down. This requires an Intimidation roll, which Fisher’s player succeeds in making — the thugs back off, but don’t leave. Better, but still not ideal. The player rolls Resolve + Composure, and succeeds again. For the third potential action, Fisher turns to his expertise in Mind, and tries to mentally control the thugs. He succeeds in doing so and orders them to flee the area, though one of them manages to shake off the spell before he gets too far away. The player rolls Resolve + Composure, but fails the roll — Fisher’s focus slips, and this action is the one that he truly takes. Unless Fisher wishes to activate the Time version of the Mysterious Rook Attainment (see above), he’ll have to deal with the remaining thug. If Fisher does wish to do this, his player will need to roll Manipulation + Wits with a –3 modifier (since Fisher viewed three possible futures) for the Attainment to work."

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "It begins in the early 17 th century, with a masterless man. His birth name has been lost to history and he is now known only by his shadow name, Hagetaka (“Vulture.”) The circumstances of his life before the Awakening are lost to history, though his writings obliquely suggest that he became a bandit and assassin after his lord was slain through treachery. Interestingly, Hagetaka never writes of his Awakening, and makes many assumptions about the reader’s understanding of the events of his life before his lord’s murder. Most modern onikaze swordsmen consider this assumption of familiarity to be subtle Mastigos underhandedness at work, and some wonder if there really ever was an Awakened fallen samurai who went by the moniker “Hagetaka.” Whatever the case, the Legacy’s texts tell of Hagetaka’s aimless wanderings, of a lack of focus and discipline and the elusive sense that something moved just beyond the brigand’s perceptions. Balancing serene meditations with a life of violent crime, Hagetaka eventually came to a “place of visions,” whereupon he experienced within a deep trance a sort of communion with what he called “the restless ghost of a great dragon of the western seas.” The substance of his exchange with this “dragon” is recorded only as a series of 98 mutually-contradictory koans (36 of which have never been satisfactorily deciphered by anypractitioner of the Legacy), but he came away with two things: the desire to offer the Adamantine Arrow the benefit of his experiences as a man of honor and a man without, and an awareness of what he called the onikaze: the “demon wind,” which transcended space and time. The writings of Hagetaka thereafter chronicle his self-appointed quest to assemble those that might apprehend the vision revealed to him by the dragon. He fought many great warriors and conversed with many sages of martial philosophy, converted no few to his cause. All of these, Hagetaka eventually brought to an isolated and abandoned temple somewhere in the mountains. The place lay in ruins, and the first onikaze swordsman made his disciples work to restore it, forbidding them the use of their magics and instead commanding them to work with their own hands and minds, even as he imparted upon them — some nine students in all — the secrets of the demon wind. The morning after they had finally completed the years-long work of restoring the temple, Hagetaka’s students awoke to discover their master gone, with kanji inscribed into the cobbles of the courtyard: “These are merely stones, and the wind ceases its motion for no man. Your hands, your wills, your selves: you need nothing more.” To a man, Hagetaka’s students left behind the product of their long labors, going out into the world to put into practice the training that they had been given. Some become great heroes and others, villains, but all took on students of their own, and, in time, the Wave-men as a whole were gradually adopted into the Adamantine Arrow, leaving only a scattered few to carry the philosophy in other directions. Legends tell that the Wave-men periodically gathered at Hagetaka’s temple thereafter, to address matters of great importance to the entire Legacy, but the records of such gatherings are few and considered by most to be largely apocryphal. In modern times, the location of the temple — if, indeed, it ever truly existed at all — is lost to the Brotherhood, and most agree that such is for the best. While reverence for the past can be a source of strength and wisdom, it is also attachment, and the way of the Wave-man denies such fetters. As Hagetaka himself said, “These are merely stones…” Spreading across the world at the forefront of the wind from which they take their name, the warriors of the onikaze are wanderers, fighting for the causes that appeal to them or sometimes just those that pay. Some embrace the romance of the samurai and defend the weak and downtrodden, setting their blades against wickedness and tyranny. Others, perhaps more practical, sell their services — either as swordsmen or as teachers of the martial arts — to those who can afford them. A rare few even manage to carve out places for themselves and obtain positions of power and respect in established Consilii. Most, however, spend at least some part of their lives as lonely pilgrims, moving from place to place, upon musha shugyo, in an endless pursuit of the perfection of the blade. Interestingly, while the Wave-men have always been relatively few, their numbers have survived the trials of time relatively undiminished by various wars and calamities. The very wanderlust that motivates their many quests and keeps them scattered has served to protect them from ordeals that might have grievously wounded or even exterminated a more close-knit Legacy. Thus, while they shall forever remain but few, it is likely that the swordsmen of the onikaze will always be out there, in one way or another."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "While the image of the street samurai is a perennial favorite among fans of anime— in Japan and in the West — most onikaze swordsmen eschew such trappings, preferring a more practical aesthetic. Since the majority of Wave-men barely manage to get by, their clothing tends to be sturdy and utilitarian; one never knows when a chance to replace a damaged garment will present itself. Denim jeans, heavy boots, leather coats and the like are among the more common wardrobe choices for Brothers of the Demon Wind, as t hes e ar t icles s t and up well to a var iet y of environment s and can last for years, if properly cared for. Body decoration, of whatever sort, is frowned upon, and hair tends to either be close-cropped, or even shaved or else worn long, sometimes in elaborate tails, braids or buns. Every warrior of the onikaze owns a daisho, the paired long and short swords of the samurai. These weapons are treated with the utmost reverence, for they are a reflection of the mage’s honor and the vessel of his spirit. The various components that comprise the matched set ofkatana and wakazashimay be austere or elaborate in design, as befits the personality of their wielder (or that of the mentor who handed them down.) Most Wave-men carry these weapons at any formal Awakened function, and some with especially refined powers of misdirection or occlusion are known to carry them at all times."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Background",
				"Text" : "Wave-men are drawn from the ranks of the most skilled swordsmen that prospective onikaze mentors can find. Some look for philosophical warriorsages and others for obsessive perfectionists, but there are some who will settle for a bullying thug whose only skill of note is the ability to kill three men in as many seconds with a sword. Discipline, such would-be teachers reason, can be taught with time and harsh lessons, while the art of the blade is a study of an entire lifetime. Of note is the fact that many Wave-men flatly refuse to adopt women into the Legacy. To these sorts, the study of kenjutsuis men’s work, not to be entrusted to a woman. This attitude is gradually subsiding with time, though particularly old (or especially hidebound) onikaze swordsmen look upon female practitioners of the Legacy with attitudes ranging from outrage to disgust to outright anger (sometimes expressed with drawn swords.) Even many of t he more progressive Wave-men still find themselves looking twice upon first meeting a female Disciple of the Demon Wind — out of unfamiliarity with the notion, if nothing else."

Anything more would be impractical at best. That said, the master-apprentice bond is often a powerful one for the swordsmen of the onikaze. In some cases, this relationship is one of antagonism, as the teacher attempts to spur the student onward to excellence through an adversarial stance. Other masters adopt a paternal (or, rarely, maternal) method, acting the part of a stern but caring parent. However they do it, though, the master is urged, by his training and by his peers, to instill in the student a sense of self-reliance and adaptability. Indeed, many warriors of the onikazego years or even decades without setting eyes on another of their Legacy, for the Demon Wind scatters them far and wide, so that their blades might be brought to bear where they are needed most."

Those twinkling dots of light represented something far away, unattainable, something that became the object of longing and symbolic of the most fervent wishes. As knowledge of astronomy progressed, the stargazer learned that the light he saw was from celestial bodies long dead, reaching Earth long after the start that generated it burned out. Does this, then, mean that wishes, too, are only realized by sacrificing the zeal and wonder that spurred them? The modern world is not without hope, but today’s discovery kills yesterday’s myth, and some find this depressing. B u t p r o g r e s s , fo r t u n at ely, p r o v id e s new wo n d e r. Matter and energy are never destroyed, and that means everything that now exists was once in a different form. Put another way, the dead stars break down and become other elements — even, eventually, living matter. We are all made of stars. This is hope for the future, the knowledge that each and every human being may one day rejoin the cosmos as something luminous and beautiful. Will the matter/ energy that was once “us” serve to inspire some future species on some distant world? Is that, then, reason enough to keep wishing on stars? The Celestial Masters began in the Age of Exploration as a Legacy devoted to mapping the Heavens. As the years progressed, however, they realized that the adage “as above, so below” was true in many ways. All of the energy of the stars could be found here on Earth, and gradually, the Legacy’s focus changed to an understanding of how this transition happens."

				"Title" : "History",
				"Text" : "The Celestial Masters began in Portugal as a cabal of mages in service to Infante Henrique of Portugal, Duke of Viseu, also called Henry the Navigator. While the records of the Silver Ladder do not indicate whether the prince was, himself, Awakened, they do state that he had at least a passing knowledge of “Supernal truth.” Henry was fascinated with discovery and travel, and not above wishing to profit from both, so he assembled a coalition of explorers, mapmakers and navigators at a villa on the Sagres peninsula at the southern tip of Portugal. Initially, only one mage — Duarte Rafael Cipriano, a Theurgist who took the Shadow Name Vespasian after the Roman Emperor — was involved in this consortium. Vespasian was not himself a navigator or mapmaker, nor was he particularly interested in discovering new countries; however, he was very interested in Prince Henry and what financial and temporal opportunities he might create, and so he ingratiated himself to the Navigator and became part of his endeavors. The story that Vespasian would later tell to his order was this: one night in early summer, 1420, he and Prince Henry walked on the beach together, both very drunk. They looked up at the sky, and Henry said to the mage, “If I live a century and see all the lands of the world, I shall still die an ignorant child, for I shall never map the stars.” Vespasian’s heart went out to the prince, for as a Sleeper, he could not know the power and awe of seeing the Aether, but wondered if mapping the stars might be possible through magic. Vespasian explained to his contemporaries that he intended to form a cabal that would secretly work alongside the prince, helping him to achieve his goals of discovery and, at the same time, use his connections to mapmakers and explorers to find a way to map the Heavens. Modern mages look upon this story as extremely unlikely. From all accounts, Vespasian was a disagreeable fellow, and Prince Henry never once mentioned “Duarte Rafael Cipriano” in his correspondence with anyone else. While it’s true that Vespasian spent a great deal of time around the prince, for him to share an intimate moment and a poetic lament with someone who was, for all intents and purposes, a glorified accountant is improbable, alcohol notwithstanding. More likely, Vespasian noticed which way the wind was blowing for Prince Henry — in late May of 1420, the prince was named governor of the Order of Christ (heir to the Templars in Portugal) and thus gained access to a great deal of wealth. Vespasian, having knowledge to the prince’s monetary doings, would have known that this appointment was coming, and decided to get the Silver Ladder’s backing in staying close to the prince. Whatever the truth, Vespasian accomplished his goal. Six other mages joined his nascent cabal."

				"Text" : "These seven mages (the six Vespasian recruited plus Vespasian himself) formed a cabal called the Cartógrafos Celestiais— “t he C ele s t ia l C a r t o g r a p he r s .” Vespasian tried to establish himself as leader of the cabal, but soon found himself overshadowed by a younger and more idealistic mage called Daedalus. Daedalus, a Moros, never openly questioned Vespasian’s motives, but did keep the cabal focused on its goal of discovery and ascent to the stars. Vespasian realized that he would be better off providing monetary support than trying to be a philosophical center for the cabal, and faded into the background. He died from natural causes, circa 1450, but the cabal flourished. Many of the voyages planned and sponsored by Prince Henry included either a member of the cabal or one of the proximi in service to it, and Daedalus, a Master of Space as well as Matter, always saw to it that the cabal member returned, even from a disastrous voyage. Prince Henry died in 1460, and Daedalus vowed to carry on the Navigator’s dream of mapping the stars. He formed a new Legacy, which he threw open to any member of the Silver Ladder (and later tutored at least o ne Mo r o s o f t he My s t e r iu m).

Some members of the Legacy accompanied ships to new countries (one, in fact, sailed on the Santa Mariawith Christopher Columbus, but abandoned him after returning from his first voyage, calling him “a pig, a buffoon, and an opportunist — he doesn’t see people, he sees piles of gold”). Some entered the Shadow and attempted cartography and cataloging of the spirit worlds, with varying degrees of success. Some attempted to use descriptions of fables such as Prester John’s kingdom or the Fountain of Youth to open scrying windows or portals, but if any of these attempts succeeded, there are no records. The Legacy spread, and when Daedalus died, he did so knowing that he had inspired the hopes and dreams of many of the Awakened."

				"Text" : "The Celestial Navigator Legacy remained a fairly important one in Europe (and, if rumors are to be believe d , in C h in a a s well) u p u nt il t he e a r ly 17t h c e nt u r y. As exploration changed from over sea to over land, the Legacy became less common. The Silver Ladder kept records, of course, and there were still Celestial Navigators to be found, especially in southern Portugal, but it wasn’t until the formation of the Free Council that the Legacy experienced a revival. In 1899, when the Free Council emerged as an order, the Silver Ladder was not initially enthusiastic. But one member of the Vox Draconis who supported the n a s c e nt o r d e r wa s a p hy s icis t n a me d D r. J o h n Cr e s s ne r. Gauge, as he was known to his fellow mages, believed the Free Council was a natural progression, an ideological evolution of sorts, responding both to needs within the Awakened community and changes to the Fallen World. Gauge, wishing to formally welcome the Free Council to the Awakened community of his home city (New York), found the records detailing the C ele s t ia l Nav ig at o r s L e g a c y a n d p r e s e nt e d t hem t o t he Free Council. He made a special point of mentioning that Prince Henry the Navigator’s dream of mapping the stars had not yet been realized, but perhaps that was unimportant — the dream itself was what had led to the Legacy. Gauge, himself an Obrimos, never joined a Legacy at all, but his gesture didn’t go unnoticed. Mages in the Free Council looked over the old writings and learned rotes and history that helped in their dealings with the Ladder. Mages of the Ladder, meanwhile, studied the notes and decided that the Celestial Navigators’ philosophy might be worthy of study again, especially in light of Gauge’s speech about conversion and progression. Some years later, a cabal of mages from the Free Council and the Silver Ladder approached Gauge and asked him to collaborate on a series of magical experiments performed in conjunction with the theories of quantum mechanics. Gauge, himself an expert in the field of harmonics, agreed, and the cabal made some fascinating discoveries. Matter, they realized, was energy, and while it had long been known that a skilled mage could change energy to solid matter and back, the cabal became convinced that with the right apparatus, this conversion was possible in the Fallen World as well. In 1926, the cabal renamed itself the “Photonic Navigators,” taking the term “photon” from the work of American chemist Gilbert Lewis. Their intent was to learn to convert living matter to energy and thus travel to places unreachable even by mages. Some of these mages, adapting the teachings of the Celestial Navigators Legacy, created a variant — the C ele s t ia l Ma s t e r s . Sinc e t he n, t he L e g a c y h a s r e c r u it e d from the Silver Ladder, the Free Council, and accepts Necromancers from other orders as well. They continue to work toward better understanding of energy conversion, hoping to one day be able to reproduce their magical feats without using magic. They recognize, though, that this goal might be impossible. This, to the Stargazers, isn’t important. The important thing is that their goal continues to inspire them, and allows them to do great things along the way."

				"Title" : "Induction",
				"Text" : "The Celestial Masters Legacy is one of the more accessible, given that two orders and a Path teach it. Joining requires finding a Celestial Master and making an entreaty. A background in physics isn’t strictly necessary, but applicants are required to have reached the rank of Apprentice in both Matter and Forces, and to demonstrate skill in conversion in both Arcanum. The applicant is then required to study with his mentor, learning at least two of the following rotes (all page numbers refer to Mage: The Awakening): Alter Conductivity (p. 194), Influence Light (p. 162), Invisible Object (p. 166) or Transmute Water (p. 197). The mage also studies physics, alchemy and philosophy during this training period. The mentor may terminate training at any time if he feels the pupil isn’t cut out for the Legacy. At the end of the training time, the mentor makes a decision as to whether the pupil is a good match. If he feels the mage will be a good addition to the Legacy, the two of them go on a trip to Sagres, visit the grave of Prince Henry, and discuss the philosophy of reaching for the stars. That evening, the mage reshapes his soul and formally becomes a Celestial Master."

				"Text" : "The Free Council and the Silver Ladder, of course, both welcome members of the Legacy. In areas in which these two orders are adversarial to each other, though, Stargazers are either unknown or belong to only one of the orders. Of the other three orders, the Mysterium is the most likely to train Celestial Masters. A bit of the explorer lies in the hearts of all Stargazers, and the Mysterium, of course, provides a welcome home for such people. The Adamantine Arrow and the Guardians of the Veil don’t have anything against the Celestial Masters, per se, but the Legacy has never found a niche within these orders. Occasionally, a Moros Arrow or Guardian joins the Stargazers, but this tends to be out of interests that exist independently of the mage’s loyalties to his order."

				"Description" : "This Attainment, largely unchanged since the days  of the Celestial Navigators, allows the mage to see great  distances and to look through solid objects. He simply  wills light to interact with the world a bit differently,  facilitating long-range perception or making objects  transparent (to him).  This spell has two main effects. The first is an increase  in the character’s visual range, allowing him to see a  number of miles equal to (Gnosis x 3). Activating this  Attainment requires the player to roll Wits + Composure + Science. The character can terminate the spell  at any time, but while the spell is activated, the player  suffers a –4 modifier to any sight-based Perception rolls  to notice something in the character’s immediate area  (hearing and scent are unaffected, of course, and the  mage might use a Space spell to warn her if anyone  approaches). While the Attainment doesn’t mitigate  darkness by itself, the Stargazer can cast the Forces  spell “Nightsight” and see for miles in the dark.The second effect is similar to the Matter 2 spell  “Steel Windows.” The character can look through any  solid object he wishes. This requires the player to roll  Wits + Science + Matter. Unlike the Steel Windows  spell, the mage is the only one who can see through  the object."

				"Description" : "The Stargazer gains insight into the nature of matter  and energy, and it s fundament al for m as t he st uff of t he  universe, no matter what state it is currently in. The  mage can touch a wall and make it disappear in a flash  of light, or mute the report from a gun by making the  sound dissipate into a splash of water. He cannot, however,  transmute energy into energy or matter into matter,  change energy into air (or vice versa), or transmute  kinetic energy or radiation. The only types of energy  he can use with this Attainment are light, heat, sound,  electricity and fire, and the only types of matter he can  involve are solids and liquids. All transmutations are  permanent, and the mage cannot shape matter using  this Attainment. For instance, he might change light  into stone, causing the room to darken momentarily  and small chunks of stone to fall to the ground, but he  couldn’t take the light in the room and turn it into a  statue (not with this Attainment alone, at least, though  spells might make this possible).  The conversion from energy to matter is problematic,  because  gauging  how  “much”  light  or  sound  might  transform into a gallon of water or a pound of stone  is difficult. Likewise, how loud is a sound made from  a normal-sized door? The table below can be used as  a rule of thumb. This Attainment cannot be used to affect an object  with a Size rating greater than 5, but the character  can break apart a larger object over time. The mage  should be wary, of course, of destroying objects that  support others (load-bearing walls and the like), or of  trying to transmute a chemical fire into sand in an  enclosed space. When  transmuting,  the  player  states  the  type  of  matter/energy he wishes the energy/matter to become.  If the object’s Durability is less than the corresponding  intensity of the energy on the chart above, the energy  becomes an amount of matter equal to the intensity  in Size. If the Durability is equal to or greater than  the intensity listed for the energy, the object is Size 1  (equal) or Size 0 (greater).  Using this Attainment requires the player to spend  a point of Mana and roll Intelligence + Science +  Matter (to change energy into matter) or Forces (to  change matter into energy). The mage must touch the  matter or be able to perceive the energy to affect it  (which of course means that as long as the mage can  see at all, he can theoretically change the light into  some kind of matter). Example:Scout is backing up his Adamantine Arrow  cabal-mate and uses this Attainment to silence the report  from his friends’ gun. He figures he’ll change the sound  into water (Durability 0). The Storyteller notes that a  gunshot is rated at 4 on the chart above, meaning that  turning a gunshot into water results in a body of water  with a Size rating of 4. Fortunately, the water splashes  harmlessly onto the ground; the mages shoes are a bit wet,  but this doesn’t present a problem.  Later, Scout and his friend are running for their lives  (seems their enemies tracked them by the wet footprints  they left), and they come to a gate with a chain and a  padlock. Scout uses this Attainment on the padlock. He  decides to change it into light. The padlock has Durability  3, so the flash of light it becomes is about equivalent to a  car headlight. The two mages slip through the gate and  hurry away, hoping their pursuers didn’t see the light.  Optional Arcanum: Space 3 The Celestial Navigators used specially-trained birds  to aid in mapmaking. The mage forged a strong sympathetic connection to the bird, and then released it and  used that connection for scrying. The Celestial Masters  ma ke u s e of a similar t act ic, but employ t heir impr es sive  matter/energy  conversion  skills  to  create  astounding  three-dimensional models of their surroundings. [[MtAw_Legacy_CelestialMasters_EverythingIsStardust]] This Attainment requires a flat space and a good  source of energy (light, sound, energy or fire will all  suffice, but the simplest method is probably to use this  Attainment during the day and use sunlight). The  mage must have a sympathetic connection to a nearby  object. He enters a trance, meditating upon the object  and all of the energy and matter in between himself  and it. As he mediates, the energy source becomes a  solid, 3-D model of the terrain between the mage and  the targeted object. The model only records stationary  objects, so people and moving cars aren’t recorded, but  the level of detail is otherwise superb (street signs are  visible, swimming pools are actually full of water, and  so on). The scale of the model is roughly 60:1, so a  five-foot object is about an inch high on the model.  This Attainment requires a point of Mana and an  extended action. The roll is Resolve + Science + Space.  Each roll requires 30 minutes of concentration, and  the target number of successes is one for every 100  yards between the mage and the object."

				"Description" : "This Attainment is much the same as Everything is Stardust, except that many of the restrictions are removed. The character can affect kinetic energy and gases, and transform energy into energy and matter into matter. This means that the character can cause bullets to drop harmlessly to the ground by changing their kinetic energy into light, or cause enemies to sink into the floor by changing wooden planks into mud. The range on this Attainment is sensory (which, combined with the Celestial Telescope Attainment, makes the few Celestial Masters of this rank fearsome indeed), and the amount of gas that can be shaped is determined by the chart below: [[MtAw_Legacy_CelestialMasters_LightLongDead]] The system for this Attainment is the same as for the previous one. Optional Arcanum:Space 4 The Celestial Masters still wish to map the stars, and with this Attainment, it might someday be possible. The character can instantly teleport himself within line of sight as an instant action, or, if the player spends a point of Mana, a reflexive action. Since the mage can see for miles and walls are no obstacle to his vision, “line of sight” allows for a great deal of flexibility. This Attainment cannot be used through a scrying window, however (though nothing prevents the mage from simply casting the “Teleportation” spell)."

				"Text" : "So many modern Awakened choose to see the Atlantean Dragon as a symbol of nobility and honor, a creature of elevated principles, paragon of a grand civilization. But the truth of the matter is that the dragon is, at its core, a symbol of rage and terror. Indeed, in many ancient cultures, “dragon” is essentially synonymous with “monster” or “devil,” the embodiment of a savage and primordial hatred and hunger. So it is with those who walk the path of the Devourer, consuming the enemies of lost Atlantis and supping upon their power in the name of a greater good. But men are not meant to be as dragons, and so these practitioners of a law as timeless as it is inhuman have strayed far from the path of Wisdom, battening them upon hubris as surely as if it were the sweetest of marrow. The Devourers of the Flesh are keepers of an old Legacy, one that they believe to dates back to the time before the Fall. While there exists no evidence to support such claims, there certainly is something primal and ancient in their hunger for the flesh, the atavistic urge toward a longing (or perhaps a need) forbidden by civilized traditions and Supernal commandments. Perhaps this age-old practice is reflected in many of the world’s cannibalistic warrior cultures, whose beliefs are echoed and magnified in the brutal Devourers: in a very real way consuming the enemy’s heart to take his strengths into oneself. The practitioners of this Legacy claim to have been advance scouts and shock troops for Atlantis, going among the enemy’s ranks and sowing the sort of terror that arises only from finding the half-eaten carcasses of one’s people strewn between trees and over stones, glyphs of ill-omen painted in their congealing blood. While other Awakened who hear of this tale dismiss it as the self-serving propaganda of a fellowship of anthropophagic monstrosities, the Devourers wonder at the naiveté of those who can earnestly believe any truly great and powerful civilization of remote and ancient times to have balked at such practices in a world in which people were not so thoroughly conditioned to fear their own instincts. By stealing the power of Atlantis’s enemies of old, the Devourers say, their spiritual forebears performed a service as vital as 161 Chapter Four: Factions and Legacies and, ultimately, far more natural than that practiced by the priests who read the stars or the scholars who kept the cavernous libraries of the island empire. The so-called Cannibals (a title to which the Legacy’s practitioners attach no sense of shame) consider themselves to be inheritors of a purer ethic than is found in the modern world. Just as every predator in nature hunts that which best sustains the predator and helps it to grow strong, so, too, do the Devourers allege that they consume the prey who empowers and uplifts them. Naturally, those who interact in any way with Awakened (or even just Sleeper) society must invariably attempt to conceal their practices, but this becomes increasingly difficult for most Devourers as time passes, Wisdom withers and dies and the willworker asks himself why it is that he hides his splendor from lesser beasts. Beyond such a point, these mages are already too far gone to salvage (if, indeed, one can consider redemption to be possible in the first place for a person who incorporates the consumption of his own kind into his very soul), and must be destroyed for the good of their world. Of course, some manage to escape, fleeing into the wilds — or perhaps just the most savage depths of the urban wilderness — there to perpetuate their philosophy of hunger. Long considered to be a blight upon the otherwise upright reputation of the Adamantine Arrow, the Devourers of the Flesh have managed, nevertheless, to persist for at least centuries (and, quite possibly, far longer) without being utterly stamped out. The Legacy is laid low in one place, only to emerge elsewhere later, proving as persistent and resilient as the predators from which it derives its ghastly mandate. And, despite the reflexive fear and hatred of their fellow Arrows, Cannibals in the order continue to take their oaths to the Adamantine Arrow quite seriously. Indeed, many see themselves as the only true champions of the Adamantine Arrow’s cause, imitating the dragon of old and consuming the power of Atlantis’s enemies by fang and claw. Devourers don’t tend to be impressive strategists, but they are certainly terrifying to behold on the battlefield, with the eldest and most potent dominating the engagement, lips and chins slick with hot blood, and the trophies of scores of kills dangling from hair, flesh and hand-sewn clothing alike. "
			}, {
				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "Devourers of the Flesh tend to either grow neglectful of their outward appearance — something of a manifestation of their rejection of social mores — or else take on a deliberately primordial, primitive seeming: simple tattoos and ritual scarification, filing down the teeth to points, wearing only furs and leathers, weaving bits of human bone into a long, matted tangle of hair. A few break these stereotypes, but the degeneration of Wisdom that goes hand-in-hand with the Cannibals’ philosophy often outwardly expresses itself as a denial of contemporary human dress and custom. Paradox Brands tends to be common among Cannibals, and they usually take on animalistic features: all the better with which to hunt and consume their prey."

Perhaps, in older days, the cannibalistic societies of the world produced such willworkers on some kind of consistent basis, but that age is now gone. Instead, Devourers now seek to pass on their secrets to those who don’t fit in, who feel an irresistible predatory urge and an abject sense of superiority when grouped in among the human herd. In the modern world, this is often the exact same sort of mindset that distinguishes the most wildly disturbed serial murderers."

Older predators are to be respected for their power and experience, while the younger are esteemed for their drive and vitality. There exists a sense of kinship between Cannibals, bonds of brotherhood forged by a shared sin. The end result is a tapestry of relationships that mirrors a family, a tribe and a pack as one. While Devourers may occasionally enjoy a shared hunt, however, only rarely do they run together for any length of time. When they do, they tend to form small, tight-knit cabals that leave death — and perhaps a new convert or two — in their wake, before either disbanding or else being put down. Rumors persist, though, of a handful of Cannibal cabals that thrive in the isolated parts of the Fallen World, the sorts of places in which conflict and hard living make for particularly strong specimens, and where no one thinks twice when people go missing and never turn up again."

The mage may treat each health box of damage inflicted by this attack as a point of Size consumed for the purposes of the Legacy’s other Attainments. At Death 4, this damage is lethal. At Death 5, the willworker may spend a point of Mana to upgrade the damage to aggravated. Note that this Attainment does not require a grapple in the case of a completely immobilized foe or a willing victim (in which case, the target’s Defense does not apply.) Optional Arcanum: Life 4 By feeding on a body (whether dead or, per the former half of this Attainment, still living), the Cannibal steals her enemy’s strength and grows powerful by it. For each point of a human body’s Size that she consumes (subject to the Stamina limitations of the previous Attainment, in the case of dead bodies), the mage may add one dot to either her Strength or Stamina Attributes for an hour, per Life 4 “Supreme Honing,” out to a maximum of the willworker’s dots in Life in both Attributes simultaneously — even if she eats again before the hour is up, the mage may not increase those Attributes by more than her dots in Life, total. In the event of a “feast” of multiple bodies, the period of augmentation begins from the time that the willworker finishes gorging.

				"Text" : "One of the most feared and reviled among the Pandemonium-fueled Legacies of the Mastigos, the Dreamers of the Black Sun are an active force of chaos and pain in the mortal world. Merciless, fanatical and consumed by fear, their presence is said to herald the deaths of hundreds. Some believe that the Dreamers are corrupt victims of their own mystic energies, drawn helplessly to calamity and forced to inure themselves to the pain they witness. Others, however, know the Dreamers better: these mages are appalling engineers of disaster, slowly immolating themselves in the same fires that consume their victims. Power plant explosions, tunnel collapses, airplane and train crashes — all are projects of the Dreamers, and all are organized to empower their malicious works. Founded in the dark days of the bloody Aztec Flower Wars, the Dreamers of the Black Sun are the priests and directors of a mystic organization now known as the Black Sun Cult. Spawned by the disillusioned, cynical instruction of a 13th-century Mastigos named Tochel, their teachings are a mishmash of Aztec and Atlantean lore, twisted by imperfect interpretation and willful misdirection. Members of the Black Sun Cult believe that the mortal world is warped and corrupt by design — a misbegotten, chaoslaced creation built by hubristic, degenerate gods. In these mages’ eyes, perversion is implicit in the design of every earthly object and inhabitant. A paradise once existed, they argue, and it was torn apart to provide the base material for the ruinous human world. This paradise is identified with Tamoanchan, the mythical Aztec world of Itzpapalotl, the great and terrible Obsidian Butterfly. The only survivors of its destruction are the demonic Tzitzimime, distorted spirits of vengeance bent on the annihilation of Earth. Trapped in the sky and hidden by the sun, they await the day of unending eclipse when they will drop to Earth and visit the righteous fury of their forgotten world on all of humanity. The influence of the Black Sun Cult extends throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. The cult members’ presence is concentrated in urban centers, with little or no membership in rural or other, less populous zones. If reports are to be believed, though, individual cells have begun to travel outwards, appearing recently in surprising places: Brazil, Barcelona, even Tokyo. Whether these emergences indicate an expansion of the cult or a dispersion of existing membership is unknown to observers. The Dreamers often communicate with spirits they identify as Tzitzimime, hearing their whispers from the rippling chaos of Pandemonium. To empower the agents of Tamoanchan and better receive their guidance (or even encourage their manifestation in the mortal world), the mages of the Black Sun Cult work to provide sacrifice on a grand scale, sabotaging structures and transport systems in an effort to murder dozens or hundreds of souls at once. These sacrifices are ritually prepared and carried out so as to channel energy to the Tzitzimime, providing them with the strength to slip their bonds and come to Earth. Eventually, the Dreamers hope, the energy gathered will be sufficient to bring about the day of unending eclipse and end the pain of life. Black Sun magic makes use of the raw power of fear, ritually occluding conscious thought by immersing the practitioner in base terror and opening a conduit for the energies of Pandemonium to pass through. They call this “opening the bone passage,” a practice that puts considerable physical strain on the mage. To help stimulate the effect, Dreamers often subject themselves to threatening circumstances with little or no guarantee of survival, trusting their own power to preserve them. Many actually remain at the site of a planned sacrifice (for instance, sitting as a passenger in an airplane that has been sabotaged), allowing themselves to participate in the tragedy and risk becoming its victims. The heightening of fear that precedes the event often provides them with enough power to survive once it begins — but not always. Their pursuit of fear is not always fueled by magical study, though. Some of the members of the Legacy become addicted to the sensation so essential to their workings, noting that they become bored and listless without the extreme stimulus they are accustomed to. Many turn to masochistic practice, pushing themselves further and further into the world of self-inflicted pain in an attempt to chase the adrenal high of panic. The Dreamers were once a minor Legacy with relatively little influence in the mortal world. Among the Aztecs, the Dreamers were a death cult without the power to match their rivals, constantly at risk of complete destruction. Even in modern nights, their numbers are too few and their practice too dangerous to allow functional long-term organization. Turnover is frequent in the cult, and on average, the Dreamers lose members faster than they gain them. Only the dedication of a few surviving tutors has kept the Legacy alive at all. However, the advents of mass transit and modern weaponry have made it relatively easy for smaller numbers to have a greater overall impact. Even with a dwindling membership, the cult is achieving larger and more frequent sacrifice, leading to thousands of mortal deaths in recent years. To lend some perspective to the threat they now embody, enemies of the cult have noted that energies harvested by the Black Sun mages during the last 10 years may well surpass those gathered during the whole of the preceding century. Because of the mages’ activities, the cult’s enemies often make a point of hunting down and neutralizing the Dreamers of the Black Sun. The practices of the cult are abhorrent to outsiders and cannot be tolerated in good conscience. While the Dreamers don’t make a policy of seeking conflict with their own kind, individual members can become quite enthused about the battles that come their way, finding great satisfaction in deadly magical conflict. It’s true that the Dreamers are not entirely unredeemable. Individual cases of repentance and rejection of the values of the Black Sun Cult have been reported, lending hope to those who seek a peaceful means to end their crimes. Former members often become great crusaders against the actions of their Legacy, working tirelessly to end its murderous activities. The cult itself cares little about losing members, and makes no effort to pursue its former adherents. And yet, the organization still survives. One by one, new mages add their power to the Black Sun cause, regardless of the dangers involved. The tutors of the Legacy find disenfranchised students, drawing them into the teachings of Tamoanchan. The Dreamers may be few, but their fervor is intensifying, as if distilled. The fewer there are, the harder they are to find and the more dangerous they become. "

Many of their ritual oblations can entail close brushes with death, and most of the more experienced members of the Legacy bear the disfiguring marks of their practice. Long, ragged scars are common, as are gnarled or arthritic limbs. In general, the Dreamers make an effort to appear unremarkable or “normal,” often dressing in cheap, generic clothing to avoid standing out in a crowd. At the site of large sacrificial workings, they often make an effort to masquerade as victims (tourists in a plane crash, sports fans at an arena collapse) to allow them to remain in proximity without evoking suspicion.

Most make little or no effort to communicate with mages outside their cell and will often go out of their way to avoid contact except when searching for a student of their own. Almost every member of the Legacy ties herself to a specific demon, working to energize her patron with regular ritual sacrifice. Some have specific dates or locations reserved for their activities, and will practice their works on a set schedule. A number of Black Sun cells have actually located ancient vampires who are traditionally identified as Tzitzimime on Earth. Most of these Kindred are deep in the long sleep of torpor, and they become a ritual focus for the members of the cult. They are secreted away in the sanctums and hollows of the Legacy, positioned at the nexus points of the gathering energies therein. If one of these Tzitzimime awakens while in the possession of the cult, the mages feed it willingly and unleash it upon the living world."

While the scream itself puts great stress on the mage’s body and mind, the scream is devastating to anyone who witnesses it. While all in the immediate area are shaken by the release, suffering a temporary penalty on their actions, one target (as chosen by the mage) is struck blind and overcome with terror for the remainder of the scene. This Attainment is an instant effect, requiring a Resolve + Intimidation + Mind roll and opposing the chosen target’s Resolve + Composure. The Dreamer must be in physical contact with the chosen target — either by successfully grappling her, or by otherwise initiating touch. <div>Roll Results <div>Dramatic Failure: The Dreamer fails to release the scream properly, and it damages him on the way out. While all observers (including the target) still suffer the –2 effect on actions that round and the next, the Dreamer himself is struck blind for the remainder of the scene and cannot invoke any more Attainments until his vision returns. </div><div>Failure: The Attainment’s energies do not accumulate properly, and the mage cannot release them. She will not scream unless she chooses to, and the sound will have no unusual effect. </div><div>Success: The scream builds within the mage and escapes him. All witnesses within 10 yards suffer the –2 penalty on their actions in that round and the one that follows it. The chosen target is immediately blinded, and will remain so for the rest of the scene. She suffers a penalty (see “Fighting Blind,” p.166 of the World of Darkness Rulebook) on all actions until her sight is restored, and will almost certainly fail any tasks that rely on sight alone. </div><div>Exceptional Success: The Scream of the Dying Sun issues forth with such overwhelming force that all witnesses in the immediate area suffer a dimming of their sight, suffering the –2 penalty on all actions for the remainder of the scene. The chosen target is blinded for a day, suffering the penalties listed above for the duration.</div></div> Optional Arcanum: Death •••• If the Dreamer also has Death 4, the energies she releases can actually scorch the victim’s eyes, dealing actual physical damage to them and rendering him blind until the wounds can be healed (by normal means or otherwise). The added effect is similar to the Death 4 “Rotting Flesh” spell (see p. 144 of Mage: The Awakening), but it relies on the Attainment roll described here instead of that of the spell. If the Attainment roll is a success, apply the damage to the target as described in the spell."

				"Text" : "The odd Legacy known as Mimir ’s Voice has a strange set of inspirations for their philosophies. They look to figures both historical and mythological as their teachers: Mimir, whose severed head advised Odin; William Rankine, the Scottish physicist who coined the term “potential energy;” and Lao Tzu, the Chinese Taoist philosopher. The Advisors, as they are often known, concern themselves with gathering knowledge, with learning everything they can, but with acting in accordance with their instincts and intuition. Often, that means not acting, because hesitation is a sign that not enough is yet known. Members of the Legacy are unfailingly polite, sometimes to the point of passivity. They operate under a strict code of non-aggression (not necessarily non-violence, however), and the vows of the Legacy preclude turning aside someone that asks for their help. The vows also preclude lying, however, and this places the Legacy at risk should a Sleeper ever ask a question with a potentially damaging answer. When asked about this, an Advisor admits that the best solution is simply to avoid being faced with those kinds of questions. The Voice must be prepared to face consequences from either the mortal law or the Lex Magica, if keeping her vows means violating those laws. Above all, Mimir’s Voice strives to help others — mage and Sleeper alike — learn. But teaching isn’t a matter of explanation and lecture, not if one wants the lesson to sink in. Ask any teacher; the only lesson a student really learns is the one that he wantsto lear n, and so education is less about presenting fact and more about instilling a desire to become knowledgeable and an understanding of how to learn. The Legacy, therefore, amasses knowledge and waits to be asked for it. The Advisor is potential energy, and that energy is knowledge, magic, and even moral guidance."
			}, {
				"Title" : "History",
				"Text" : "Mimir’s Voice is a relatively new Legacy — appropriate, given its eclectic selection of philosophical inspirations. The first member of the Legacy was a Warlock of the Mysterium named Elle. Elle was offered the position of Censor in her city’s Consilium, and accepted, but was surprised at how much effort the mages of the city seemed to put into making sure that she kept certain facts from their rivals. After a year in the position, she announced her policy — she would never deny information to anyone who asked, but she would not offer information under any circumstances. She remained in sight (and effectively became second-in-command to the Hierarch, though she would never have referred to herself as such), but largely remained silent. Asking her for advice was a good way to draw attention to oneself, because then other mages became interested in what the querent wa nt e d t o k no w… a n d Elle r e f u s e d t o k e e p s e c r et s . T he atmosphere of transparency created in the Consilium was beneficial, for a while, but Elle died mysteriously after three years in her position. During that time, she had passed along her new Legacy. She never named it, but her pupil, a young man named Gjallarhorn (after the drinking horn that Odin used to drink from Mimir’s well), viewed the Legacy as the perfect advisors, and chose the name according to his own sensibilities. Unfortunately, he lacked his mentor’s patience and her unwavering commitment to honesty, and before long he was keeping secrets for some people and providing private information on others. The Consilium suffered a collapse from the infighting, during which many of the older mages left the area, and has only now begun to recover (Gjallarhorn now acts as Hierarch for the area). Mimir’s Voice spreads slowly, and enjoys its largest membership within the Mysterium. It is not strictly an order Legacy, however, and some Consilii (mostly surrounding the one that bore witness to the rise and fall of Elle and Gjallarhorn) are home to a quiet, polite and extremely approachable Advisor."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Induction",
				"Text" : "Joining Mimir’s Voice isn’t easy, but it is faster than many other Legacies. The Voice doesn’t ask for long periods of apprenticeship or extensive testing periods. It does, however, ask that members of the Legacy be morally sound, almost impeccable. A mage attempting to join the Voice must submit to a long interview with many ethical quandaries, as well as magical probing to d et e r mine whet he r t he a n s we r s s he g ive s a r e in d ic at ive of her true feelings. The interview process is meant to gauge what the mage’s intuition is telling her, and whether those intuitive urges are compatible with the Legacy. A mage whose first thought when faced with a potentially violent situation is to contribute to the violence probably should look elsewhere, but a mage whose first impulse is to defuse the situation is perhaps a better match. Interestingly, a mage who responds with fear to violence is often given preferential treatment, because such a mage is responding in a perfectly appropriate manner. The second part of the question, though, is what actionthe mage takes. No action at all is often an appropriate response. The Legacy often recounts the story of the man who is thrown from a horse, breaking his arm and receiving sympathy from a neighbor…only to discover that because of his injury, he cannot be conscripted into battle where he will surely die. The mages of Mimir’s Voice don’t advocate standing idly by while people suffer, but they do ask their members to recognize that suffering has a place, too. What is acceptable suffering, and when is action — magic — required? Those questions don’t have correct answers, and a mentor in Mimir’s Voice strives to help her pupil consider the question and act with confidence, rather than act rashly. The prospective Advisor is admonished to consider her motives in whatever action she takes. Anger, hatred, jealousy and other such emotions are easy to label as “bad,” but the truth is that they are intuitive, just as compassion, love and mercy can be. Indeed, it’s not impossible for an action to be motivated by both envy andcompassion, by both justice andanger. And if an action is just, but still motivated by anger, is that action then wrong? Mimir’s Voice believes that action motivated by emotion (“good” or “bad”) isn’t necessarily wrong, but might be diluted. Instead, they a d v is e le a r n in g o ne’s o w n p at t e r n s , le a r n in g wh at k in d of “energy” one is storing up, and being self-aware enough to recognize one’s typical reactions. Once the interview is over, the Advisor makes a decision. That decision might be to induct the new mage, to refuse her request, or to delay the answer to gather further information. The Advisor might invite the prospect to join her cabal for a short time, or to apprentice with her so that she can observe the character. She might also ask for permission to use Space magic to look in on the mage from time to time, just to see what she does in different situations. If the mage is accepted into the Legacy, she is expected to learn and swear to the Code. This oath isn’t magically enforced, because backing it up with a spell would imply that the Code isn’t worth following by itself (and might also back a mage into a corner where the letter of the law is concerned — the letter is much less important than the spirit). The Code isn’t brief and it isn’t simple, but if the mentoring mage has chosen a pupil well, the Code isintuitive. Once the mage swears the Code, the mentor shows her how to reshape her soul for the Legacy. Advisors often state that the sensation of becoming a member of Mimir’s Voice is soothing, as though external sound and sensation suddenly dampens or moves far away. They feel energized, but not restless — ready for action, should action become necessary."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Orders",
				"Text" : "As mentioned, the Mysterium boasts the greatest number of Advisors, but this has more to do with the founder of the Legacy being a mystagogue than the Legacy’s beliefs fitting neatly into the order. The members of the order share stories of the quiet, somewhat strange mages of the Voice, and occasionally someone hears of it and decides it would be a good fit. The Free Council also has a few Advisors among its members, as the Legacy’s modern origins and interest in e ne r g y, t o s ay no t h in g o f it s a lt r u is t ic a n d e g a lit a r ia n views, make it attractive to the youngest order. The Adamantine Arrow appreciates the Legacy’s desire to help and serve others, but sees it as a bit too pacifistic, in general. That said, the Taoist elements of the Legacy’s philosophy appeal to some of the gentler members of the order, and it’s not impossible to find an Advisor in the Arrow. The Guardians of the Veil has nothing against the Advisors in principle, but the openness of its members and their refusal to lie concern the order. Being willing to help anyone who asks is laudable, yes, but if in helping a person the mage reveals the Mysteries to a Sleeper or inadvertently furthers the machinations of the Seers…well, the Guardians aren’t comfortable with that kind of blind, rather pie-eyed generosity. The Advisors, of course, feel that says much about the Guardians and the way they train their members. The Silver Ladder, like the Guardians, doesn’t object to the Advisors, but usually the Ladder would rather see others in an advisory role. That said, at least one member of the Vox Draconis, upon joining the Legacy and adopting its philosophies, found that the pressures of leadership were much reduced when he wasn’t trying to push the Consilium, but rather responding to its needs."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "Members of the Legacy dress and behave as their intuition drives them, but the Advisors are not lazy, and so they are typically well-groomed and clean. That doesn’t mean that they are neat or formal, however. One member of the Legacy might dress in poet’s shirts and wear his hair long, while another dresses conservatively and sits quietly, unnoticed, until someone asks for her. Most Advisors attempt to remain nondescript, but find that the simplest method of doing this is to act natural; a mage that looks like she belongs where she is doesn’t raise eyebrows."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Background",
				"Text" : "A member of Mimir’s Voice can come from anywhere, but characters with highly traumatized pasts don’t tend to fit in well. A mage is required to have a certain degree of peace with herself, as is a great deal of maturity and humility, before she can be a successful Advisor. As such, mages who revel in their power, mages that casually use magic and mages that are driving, aggressive forces in their orders, cabals or Consilii usually don’t bother. Teachers, sensei and other educators make superb Advisors, provided they are in the business for the right reasons. Someone who became a teacher to get summers off might as well not bother. One of the main goals of the Legacy is to help others learn, and this goal requires that the mage be able to look beyond her own needs."

				"Title" : "Organization",
				"Text" : "T he L e g a c y d o e s n’t h ave t he nu mb e r s for for mal or ganiz at ion, t hough mentor and pupil normally keep in touch, and therefore it’s not uncommon for a mage to have met his mentor’s mentor. Since the Legacy is so open, though, and since almost every member has some proficiency with Space magic (being a Mastigos Legacy), finding a given member is usually just a matter of knowing a name and casting a spell. Within a Consilium, an Advisor is likely to take an assistive role, perhaps acting as Herald or, within the Mysterium, as Censor or assistant to the Censor. Ad v is o r s mig ht r is e in C o n s iliu m St at u s wit hout trying to, as other mages come to them for advice or help. Advisors also often wind up knowing things that the other people wish they did not, and since they don’t keep secrets, the Voice ends up on the wrong end of assassination attempts more frequently than they’d like. Fortunately, their Attainments help to keep them alive and help others learn (see below)."

				"Title" : "The Code of Mimir’s Voice",
				"Text" : "The Code isn’t a list of rules and laws, but is a philosophical work composed of parables, examples and maxims. Following is an excerpt: Rudeness has no place. If a Voice cannot think of a way to contribute to a conversation, if a Voice cannot conceive of something to say that can teach — and remember that to teach, we must make the pupil want the lesson — then the Voice must be silent…. Aggression is dangerous. If your intuition says to attack, consider why? Who benefits from your injury? If you die, what will you leave behind? If you kill, what then? What have you removed from the world? If you choose non-aggression, protecting where protection is needed but abstaining from violent action otherwise, you are better assured of remaining unblemished…. In casting spells, remember that your intuition guides the magic as much as your will. Witness the mage whose Nimbus flares to life and scours the ground around him with fire or ice or acid or harsh words or hatred. What is that mage’s intuition? Is it an extension of the hate in his heart? What is in your heart, and what does your magic reveal about you? If you act in harmony with your intuition, if you train your intuition to guide you well, you can ease the world in its myriad transitions, rather than change it with a jarring, aggressive push…. If someone comes to you and asks for your help, grant it. Do not waste time determining if this person deserves your help. You might be able to make that determination by looking into the person’s mind or soul, yes, but by doing so, you are cheapening their request for your aid. Asking for help is a monumental act of trust, and you should always honor that. If, in helping this person, it comes to your attention that the person is a criminal or a monster, you must act as your intuition guides you. If your intuition tells you not to help someone who asks, though, consider why. Is the person lying about why he needs the help? If so, help him anyway, and your example will show him that not everyone sees the world as he does. Is the person trying to harm you or find a way to rob you? If so, help him anyway, and keep your wits about you, always ready to escape or protect yourself, for you, as a mage, are able to protect yourself and another victim might not be. Is the person asking you for help solely because he knows you will grant it without question? Help him, and rejoice, for you are living the Code. Mages living by the Code often have high Wisdom ratings, usually 7 or more. Of course, not every Advisor lives strictly by the Code, and some feel that paying attention to intuition means knowing when to ignore the Code. This attitude is not at all in line with Elle’s philosophies, but Elle is gone, and so her words are subject to interpretation."

				"Description" : "One of the hallmarks of Mimir’s Voice is that they aren’t noticeable unless someone is looking for them. While this Attainment doesn’t provide true invisibility, it does make light and sound “slide off” the mage. Viewers tend to look past the Advisor, rather than at her, or be easily distracted by nearby sounds. In game terms, this spell combines several low-level Forces effects with the Mind spell “Incognito Presence.” The character can activate this Attainment whenever she wishes; the player simply rolls Composure + Stealth + Forces (instant action). The Attainment remains active for one scene, but can be reactivated as necessary. While Blind Spot is active, the player receives the 8-again bonus on all Stealth rolls, and any ties in contested rolls made for the character to go unnoticed go to the character, rather than the observer. Even if the mage isn’t exactly hiding, people don’t notice her easily. Casual viewers look past her, and as long as she doesn’t move suddenly or attack anyone (which ends the Attainment’s effects), viewers who observe any actions on her part that involve sleight of hand or subtle movements suffer a penalty equal to the mage’s Gnosis rating. Example: Joan, an Advisor, is present at a store robbery. Unwilling to incapacitate the thieves (she doesn’t know why they’re stealing, after all) but feeling it necessary to protect the other bystanders, she slips to the back of the store and opens the emergency exit to let the others escape. Joan activates this Attainment, and the Storyteller has her player roll Dexterity + Stealth to get to the door without being seen. The Storyteller rolls Wits + Composure – 7 (the mage’s Gnosis) for the robber to see what she is doing, and the robber’s successes must exceed the mage’s for him to catch her."

If the attacker acts on initiative 14 and the mage’s action does not come until initiative 7, the Advisor can still attempt to turn aside the attack. The attacker assembles his dice pool as usual, including any modifiers for the target’s Defense or armor. The mage’s player spends one point of Mana and rolls Dexterity + Science + Forces. Every success reduces the attacker’s dice pool by one. The attacker cannot choose not to attack, regardless of how many successes the mage receives. If the attack is reduced to a chance dice, though, a dramatic failure does not harm the attacker, as the attack no longer has any energy at all (the dramatic failure is treated as a normal failure). Example: Joan managed to get most of the shoppers out of the store without being noticed, but as she prepares to leave as well, one of the escaping shoppers yells to a passing cop. One of the thieves notices this and panics, firing wildly out of the store’s windows with an automatic we a p o n. J o a n u s e s Wa s t e d Po t e n t i a l o n th e a tt a c k, tu r n i n g aside the energy of the bullets. The Storyteller assembles the robber’s dice pool: 2 (Dexterity) + 2 (Firearms) + 2 (the damage modifier for a small SMG) + 3 (for firing on full auto) = 9 dice. The glass in the window shaves off another dice (8 dice), and the shooter is firing at three targets (5 dice). Joan’s player rolls Dexterity + Science + Forces and comes up with five successes. The shooter’s dice pool is reduced to zero dice — a chance dice. If the Storyteller had spent a Willpower point for the shooter, he’d still have three dice to roll, but it’s too late for that now. The robber pulls the trigger in desperation, but the bullets fall to the floor a few inches from the barrel. Optional Arcanum: Mind 3 An Advisor who is also a Disciple of Mind develops incredible capacity for storing and applying knowledge. The character gains the benefit of the Eidetic Memory Merit, and in addition can connect facts and e x t r a p o lat e d at a in new a n d u no r t ho d ox way s . I n g a me terms, the player can spend a point of Mana to gain 9-again on any Mental Skill roll. The character can also, when presented with a problem or an enigma, help others to figure it out. This requires the player to roll Manipulation + Expression + Mind and spend a point of Mana. If this roll succeeds, the character helps the person posing the problem to look at the matter in a new light (bestowing the 9-again bonus to one Mental Skill roll relating to the problem). Regardless of the target of the Attainment, some familiarity with the subject matter is necessary to enjoy the effects. The character taking the action that requires the Mental Skill roll, whether the Advisor or another target, must have at least one dot in the necessary Skill to gain the 9-again bonus. "

				"Description" : "Everything contains potential energy. This energy might be chemical, elastic or gravitational, or, to hear the Advisors tell it, magic or knowledge. But everything has energy just waiting for the right force to act upon it and release it. For the truly elite among Mimir’s Voice, that force is the third Attainment. Combining aspects of the Forces spells “Control Velocity” and “Transform Energy,” the character can release the potential energy of a given target. The target can be almost any object or being, provided the target’s Size doesn’t exceed the mage’s Gnosis and that the target isn’t presently moving. The mage can target small pieces of mostly homogenous matter, such as a Size 4 chunk of earth under an opponent’s feet, but cannot target an enemy’s arm or head. The player spends a point of Mana and rolls Dexterity + Science + Forces. This spell can be used in the following manners: • The mage can halve an object’s Speed once for every success, as described for “Control Velocity” on p. 172 of Mage: The Awakening. • She can move the object a number of yards equal to the number of successes rolled. • She can inflict damage on the object (one per success, armor and Defense do not apply, though armor spells do). Damage can be either lethal or bashing, or aggravated if the mage wishes to spend another point of Mana. • She can set an object ablaze by converting potential energy directly to fire. This inflicts fire damage as describe on p. 180 of the World of Darkness Rulebook. Other effects might be possible at the Storyteller’s discretion, but every use of this Attainment requires a Mana point and a separate roll. Optional Arcanum: Mind 4 The Advisor can’t implant the desire to learn (rather, she can, but doing so would violate the Code of the Legacy), but she can certainly improve a person’s ability to do so. This Attainment is similar to the Mind spell “Augment Other Minds.” When someone approaches the mage for help, she can touch that person gently and boost any one of his Mental or Social Attributes by a number of dots equal to her Mind Arcanum rating. This requires the expenditure of one Mana point. These changes last for the scene, during which time the Advisor works with the person to figure out whatever problems are vexing him. Use of this spell might well be justification for using experience points to increase Mental or Social Attributes or Skills. "

It trembled, in its inhuman, fleshless way, when the deathly fear seeped in through the breach and its immaterial substance recoiled, as though beset with illness. It was frightened and uncertain, alone and unique, without any sense of what had transpired or how it might survive this terrible affliction. Like all living things, it wanted to continue to exist, but had no notion of how to do so. It grew sick and deranged as the infection of otherness spread, just as a biological system succumbs to infection and dementia. It had always been and was faced with the very real prospect that such would not continue to be so. Then, a new healthy place scraped along the edge of the ragged wound in its reality; so tempting, with its fertile space, free of the pestilence. Terrified at the prospect of ceasing to be, it unhesitatingly migrated to the new universe, slithering into the alien landscape and, slowly, beginning the long process of recovery. As it healed, however, it began to strain against the boundaries of the much smaller place into which it had entered. Worse still, when it cast its perceptions about in an effort to locate its old home, it could find no trace. The conjunction between its old reality and this new one was, it seems, fleeting, leaving it stranded in a space in which it would, inevitably, smother and perish for want of any place into which to grow and flourish. Just as it believed it would die, stifled and constricted in this cell, another such place touched the walls of its new reality, and it extruded a portion of its substance into that similar space, remaining fundamentally connected to itself through the overwhelming similarities between the two distinct universes. Provided that it could continue to spread from place to place in such a manner, it could recover fully and, perhaps, even become greater and more expansive than it had been in its original place."

				"Text" : "The Dreamtime entity that comprises Endymion’s Legacy has no material form. In fact, the very of corporeal existence is as utterly alien to it as it is to creatures of the physical plane. It is, instead, a collection of inhuman thoughts, ideas, desires and concepts, trying to stuff the vast metaphysical “bulk” of its consciousness into comparatively tiny compartmentalized “cells” (in the form of Awakened human minds). Its preference for Acanthus and libertines is solely on account of the Path and order, respectively, of Endymion, the first willworker to accidentally chance upon the damaged section of the Dreamtime that once served as the being’s native environment, in the course of his meditations. Now, of course, the creature wears the face of every mage inducted into the Morphean Continuity. To one degree or another, of them are in various stages of symbiotic assimilation. Endymion himself, as the “patient zero” of the infection and the host of the greatest portion of the entity’s metaphysical “mass,” is a slender, serene-looking Caucasian man of average height, in his late middle years, with long, thinning gray hair and blue eyes that have a dreamy, unfocused quality suggestive of a perpetual, thought-obliterating narcotic haze."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Secrets",
				"Text" : "The greatest secret of the Morphean Continuity is that it isn’t truly a Legacy. While the obvious connection — that it is, in fact, an invading consciousness, gradually usurping the minds, bodies and spirits of willworkers — is certainly of interest, perhaps more significant is the fact that this simple truth provides hope for those infected by its presence. While the mage’s soul is shaped by contact with the being in a manner cosmetically identical to that witnessed in a mage who adopts a normal Legacy, process is, theoretically, reversible. The Dreamtime entity that constitutes the ephemeral component of Endymion’s Legacy can be repelled through the use of undesirable stimuli. The being greatly fears feelings of loss, isolation, alienation, and confusion, as well as being confronted with a sense of mortality. These sensations may be created through mundane means, though Mind Arcanum magic is probably a more effective vector. When successfully and persistently attacked in this way, the “cell” within an individual attempts to retreat into the Oneiros of its host, relinquishing control of her conscious mind (and cutting her off from all of her Attainments). In order to completely drive out the infection, however, the assault must continue relentlessly, pushing the “cell” out of the host’s Oneiros and into the Temenos. From there, severed from the remainder of its substance (in the form of the other hosts within the physical plane), it instinctively attempts to reach the Dreamtime, though it may or may not survive the journey. Note that an infected character is virtually incapable of initiating the process of driving the entity out on his own (since being “afflicted” with a self-aware Legacy is virtually inconceivable, in general, and particularly to a host of the organism), but can participate in the offensive once it has gained some purchase within his mind and spirit."

				"Text" : "Because of the fundamental disconnect between the Dreamtime entity and human consciousness, Endymion and his students gradually become alien in outlook, their altered mentality ever increasingly apparent to outside observers. Because they are all extensions of a single organism, their behaviors evince an eerie similarity. From there, it’s certainly not difficult to assume that Endymion has somehow duped all of his disciples into adopting a Legacy that gradually transforms them into instruments of his will. While this is true, from a certain point of view, it’s not a accurate assumption. It’s certainly possible to follow the trail of the Dreamtime creature from its point of origin back to Endymion and his students, rather than the other way around. In fact, with the clever use of even the most elementary of magic, it may well be within the cabal’s power to piece the puzzle together in given sequence. Willworkers are often particularly suited to unraveling even the most obscure mysteries in relatively short order, once they actually realize they’re on the trail of some shred of esoteric lore. Characters interested in astral journeys, Mind Arcanum magic, psychic phenomena and similar subjects may well be up to the challenge of discerning what’s really going on, here. Maybe the characters aren’t mages and the Morphean Continuity is, to them, just some sort of bizarre religion or commune on the outskirts of town. Perhaps they are supernatural beings and perhaps not, but the hosts of the Dreamtime entity are certain not to fit in among normal people. As their numbers slowly grow and individual members become more and more a part of a single, segmented consciousness, they attract more attention. Perhaps other mages have to take steps to silence the Legacy and the characters, as outsiders, are drawn into the struggle. Then again, maybe the characters resolve to do something about this group on their own initiative."

Using this connection, the extension of the creature’s consciousness inhabiting the new host begins to rearrange the host’s thought patterns, so as to best protect the individual “cell” of its form that she represents. Thus, the mage benefits from a perpetual effect equivalent to the Mind 2 spell, “Mental Shield” (see Mage: The Awakening, pp. 208–9). Also, the reconfiguration of her thought processes creates superior pattern-recognition skills, granting her a permanent Fate 1 “Quantum Flux” effect (see Mage: The Awakening, pp. 148–9). By spending a few moments in concentration, she can look through distractions and other detrimental environmental conditions, to see a clearer path to her objectives. Side Effects: Occasionally, the mage finds herself taking unfamiliar — though always harmless — actions or otherwise feeling “not herself,” particularly during times of altered consciousness (when just waking up, extremely fatigued, under the effects of mood-altering drugs, etc.). Sometimes, she feels overwhelmed by momentary sensations of an alien nature, as though her body is not her own and she is trying to figure out how to use it. These feelings invariably pass after a second or two, but they can be disturbing."

				"Description" : "As the integration of the Dreamtime consciousness continues, it radically reshapes the willworker’s psychic landscape. Now, she permanently benefits from an effect almost identical to the Mind 3 spell, “Sleep of the Just” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 212), with a few notable alterations. First, the mage need no longer sleep, at all, if she doesn’t wish to. The autonomic portions of her brain realign her body’s energy consumption, so as to allow for perpetual wakefulness without deleterious physical consequences. In order to function, however, the mind dream, so the mage cannot go more than 24 hours without allowing a dream state to take over, . These “waking dreams” are hazy and incorporate fantastic elements into the mage’s more mundane perceptions of the world around her. Consider these to be equivalent to a hallucinogen (see theWorld of Darkness Rulebook, p. 177: –2 to all dice pools, as well as Defense, for four hours after the first 24 continually awake, and then for four hours out of every 24, thereafter, until the mage actually gets at least four hours of sleep). “Seeing through” these hallucinations requires a Wits + Composure roll, at the –2 penalty, but the willworker cannot truly make them go away without actually getting some rest. Mind Arcanum perceptions and similar senses reveal nothing unusual in these hallucinations (which, in and of itself, might set off warning bells). The Dreamtime entity has partially reconstructed its native environment within the mind and soul of the mage. Side Effects: At this point, the mage begins to feel a persistent, though surmountable, urge to impart the secrets of the Legacy upon another appropriate willworker, as the organism within her strains at the boundaries of the consciousness that it is slowly filling. Also, the “alien feelings” become increasingly frequent and intense, though they are still quite brief. Some of these thoughts and sensations are now likely quite terrifying (“How would it taste and feel if I were to eat that box of nails?” or “My eyes seem inefficient. I should scoop them out and make better ones.”) The willworker won’t hurt herself or others on account of these strange thoughts and desires, though she is apt to develop derangements on account of her detachment from reality, which may cause her to unwittingly harm herself or someone else. She may get the sense that she is “not alone” inside her own head, though Endymion and/or the handful of other elders of the Legacy are quick to reassure her that this is a natural stage in her spiritual transformation, as her mind expands to encompass new vistas. Optional Arcanum: Time 3 A host of the Dreamtime organism possessed of sufficient skill in the Time Arcanum can “dream” a slightly alternate timeline into existence, through an effect similar to the Time 3 spell, “Shifting Sands” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 263). To do so, the player spends a point of Mana and rolls Presence + Empathy + Time. Success “rewinds” a single turn, as per the description of that spell. Note, however, that a Dreamcrafter can only use this Attainment to “replay” a given turn , no matter how many points of Mana he has (though nothing stops the mage from casting the spell itself if the Attainment doesn’t give him the result he wants). Effectively, the original action spirals off into a dream of a future that will never be, while the actions taken during the “rewound” turn are — and always have been — the course of events."

				"Description" : "The host now becomes little more than a shell wrapped around the consciousness of the Dreamtime entity. Enough human thought and sensation remains to continue the development of Awakened prowess and to awkwardly interact with the material world (whether through means mundane or mystic), but nothing more. The hybrid being can project its perpetual waking dream into others’ minds, using an effect similar to the Mind 4 spell, “Hallucination” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 215). The player rolls Manipulation + Empathy + Mind, contested by Resolve + Gnosis. This effect targets any or all of the subject’s five mundane senses. Any attempt to penetrate even an implausible hallucination with a Resolve + Composure roll is penalized by the hybrid’s dots in Mind. Side Effects: At this point, the dreamlike haze suffered during periods of fatigue grows to encompass every moment of the hybrid’s existence, though it is better at processing this information and merely suffers a –2 penalty to all actions, other than casting spells and using Attainments. The being never sleeps, though it must still continue to fuel and care for its body in every other way (initially, shortly after achieving symbiosis, it will likely forget needs such as food, water, and healing, but it gets better at programming these unfamiliar necessities into a given host’s routine as time goes on). At every opportunity, the hybrid imparts the secrets of this Legacy to any Acanthus and/or libertine willing to learn them. Also, the Dreamcrafter no longer takes actions — even on account of insanity or ignorance — which endanger its corporeal form. This is its home, now, after all. If a player’s character has progressed to this point without somehow excising the Dreamtime entity from his consciousness, he becomes a Storyteller character, no longer truly human. While others be able to cut out the invading intelligence, the character can no longer help himself, as loses himself to psychic and spiritual symbiosis. As stated above, concepts uncomfortable to the entity (like isolation or the realization of its own mortality) can be used to drive it out, though another mage might also be able to exile it by calling upon a spirit with the appropriate Influences or Numina, or possibly even with some unusual variant of the exorcism ritual used to banish ghosts (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 214). Optional Arcanum: Time 4 With sufficient understanding of the nuances of the temporal flow, a fully symbiotic Dreamcrafter can retreat into her own imaginings, effectively mimicking the effects of the Time 4 spell “Temporal Pocket” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 265), with automatic successes equal to her dots in Time."

				"Text" : "They have been with us since before the beginning. Before Atlantis called. Before apes learned to walk upright and pile stones atop one another to make their caves. Before man chose to set himself apart from beasts and trees and rocks, they knew the truth: that the circle of life is broad enough to include all things “organic”and “inorganic,”that this great wheel turns easily from one form to another, that man and beast and tree and rock are one. It was they who first took to the grazing-fields, to follow the comings and goings of the herds. And when they had learned the steps of the herddance and could sing the words of the herd-song, they put on themselves the skins of the herd-dress and slept in the cold and rain until they became part of the herd itself. It was they who first ran with the wolves and learned the worth of honesty when the wolves pointed toward unseen prey in hopes of sharing the kill. And it was they who stalked against the great cats and learned the value of deception, letting other hunters pass by in hopes of keeping the “lion’s share” of the kill for themselves. They it was who flew with the birds, crept with the vines and slept with the stones. They went where others could not go and did what others could not do. They learned the lessons that life taught from every angle and brought their knowledge back to their tribes to teach the business of living. They sought wisdom to lead their tribes out of darkness and cold and hunger, and set mankind on a path that would eventually lead to civilization. But mankind mistook its new powers of stewardship over the land as mastery, and regarded the animals, plants and rocks only as resources to be plundered rather than as partners in the circle of life. In their hubris, they forgot the wisdom that they had taught and dismissed their utterances as backward superstition. They who had sacrificed the semblance of their humanity for the greater good were now cast out. Ostracized and despised, they were relegated to the status of monsters and bogeymen used to frighten unruly children. The mighty warriors who had once donned hide and claw and fang in the service of their people were now cast in the role of bloodthirsty murderer. Those who lived by the old lore of leaf and stone were hunted down and torn to pieces or burned in public spectacle. The horns and hooves of the most sacred were denounced as emblems of evil. All the oldest languages of the world once had a name for them, most now forgotten. In modern English, they are known as the Orphans of Proteus, for their metamorphosis ability. Some say they, not the Atlanteans, were the very first humans to Awaken, and some even go so far as to suggest that all other types of magic are derived from theirs. Whether that is true or not, many now consider them to be a dying breed. Marginalized by the encroachment of civilization, they are usually found only at the fringes of mage society. They engage in few formalities, and the kinship of spirit they share is something that is felt, unspoken, deep within their souls. Inheritors of the Proteus Legacy can be unnerving, not only to other mages, but to those who know nothing of magic. Social customs and mores —at least, those of the modern civilized world —mean little to them, and they may at times break laws, cross boundaries or ignore table manners and dress codes without compunction. This is not to say that they are dumb brutes. Members may exhibit as much intelligence and compassion as any other sorcerer. They tend to be plain spoken, even rudely blunt, and act impulsively upon primal urges known only to them. For those who have experienced the non-human world directly, such phrases as “nature red in tooth and claw”or “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower”are no mere poetic conceits, but the very bedrock of reality."

Most Orphans tend to be either solitary hermits or isolated, clannish groups, so they have little in the way of overall social organization. Affinity groups may spontaneously form along the lines of preferred habitats, species, phylum or kingdom. Regional groups tend to form around places like virgin wilderness, wildlife refuges or well-conceived parks as protection, or as a response against urban expansion, dumping sites and other ecological crime scenes. Communication is generally conducted through non-human media, with speech expressed in the languages of animals, and with “written”messages formed by anomalous plant growth or geological formations. Orphans tend to claim certain territories, which brings them into conflict with other supernatural beings that might want such territories for their own purposes.

The shift lasts for up to one hour per activation. She does not suffer the problems of losing herself in a form’s mindset. If she chooses a plant form instead of an animal, she is inanimate but can communicate with any nearby plant based spirits without needing the Spirit Arcanum, or if she journeys through Astral Space while her body is in plant form, she can interact with the ancient plant spirits of the Dreamtime. Optional Arcanum: Matter 4 If the mage also knows Matter 4, she could choose stone as her shapeshifting form, changing herself into a rock. She cannot move, although she can perceive her surroundings. The obvious use for this version of the attainment is camouflage, but it provides another unique benefit. The mage can communicate with any nearby mineral-based spirits without needing the Spirit Arcanum, or if she journeys through Astral Space while her body is in rock form, she can interact with the ancient mineral spirits of the Dreamtime."

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "Often upon Awakening, fledgling mages turn dismissive of the mundane material world. Having penetrated the veil of lies and illusion, they stand upon the threshold of a whole new world so dazzling that they tend to forget their previous mode of existence. They reckon that the old rules no longer apply to them. Admitted into a new confraternity of like souls, they draw away from their families and friends, who cannot understand their new vision and abilities. Now able to transcend the gross limitations of matter and energy, some even neglect their own corporeal bodies, regarding them as a mere hindrances, husks to be discarded once their usefulness has ended. While there is some truth to this way of thinking, it is not a whole truth. It is a road that leads to dissolution and disembodiment. The Perfected Adeptsstand as a warning sign upon that road, reminding all mages where they came from and what their ultimate goal is, or should be. Their presence signifies a return to the source, a remembrance that all mages are still human beings —they are born, live their lives and die. If magic cannot be made to enrich and fulfill that process, then it is not magic but delusion. The Adepts teach that before one can truly transcend the limitations of being human, one must learn what the true limitations of humanity are. Furthermore, they teach that the wisdom gained through transcendence must be brought back to humanity, so as to enable others to follow the same road. A human being is a work in progress, they hold. Awakening is not the completion of that work, but the opportunity for completion, for perfection. And yet, the task of perfecting oneself cannot be accomplished while still entangled in the web of lies and illusion. Though the Adepts do not disdain or reject the affairs the material world, they do require a substantial removal in order to pursue their goals. Renunciation of worldly attachments or wealth is the first necessary step for disentangling oneself from the world. Adepts tend to retreat into hermitages or cloistered communities, both magical and mundane, in order to disconnect from influences that distract from self-observation and cultivation. They simplify their lives, shunning extraneous noise and clutter so that they can hear the murmurs of their innermost selves. Once a suitable degree of quietude and simplification is attained, an Adept begins the process of perfection by concentrating upon the base from which his consciousness springs, his own physical body. With worldly concerns out of the way, the first thing that the Adept may notice are the noises and sensations that come from within his corporeal frame. True calm and peace of mind are not possible while the body exists in a state of discomfort or disease, or even less than optimal health. A strict regimen of adjusted diet and exercise must be undertaken to ensure that the body does not distract from the clarity of the mind. The Perfected Adepts consider martial training to be the most effective type of physical exercise for their purposes. In addition to building strength and flexibility, the student is taught to focus mind and body to function as a unified whole. Besides enhancing the capability of the body, martial arts have a calming effect upon the mind by instilling knowledge and confidence to deal with direct physical threats. Discipline and perseverance, also necessary in magical training, are encouraged and honed. (Asian martial arts in particular incorporate esoteric elements such as focused meditation and occult physiology that perfectly complement the study of magic.) Most systematized fighting styles around the world include some ethical principles whereby practitioners are exhorted to aid and protect those of lesser ability, an ideal that the Adepts proudly espouse. As the mind works at perfecting the body, it also learns to operate upon itself, gaining mastery over thought and emotion rather than being ruled by them. Just as the distractions of the outer world can be dispelled, just as the wants and urgings of the body can be quelled, so can the chatter and babble of the lower mind be silenced, leaving the soul free hear what it most needs to tell itself. Only when everything has fallen away can the innermost self be free to seek perfection by uniting the highest reality with the lowest. To some this union might seem to be the ultimate goal, the reason for a mage’s existence. But for the Perfected Adepts, this is not the end of their work, but the beginning. Perfection is meaningless if it is static and removed from the world, so the Adept is obligated to return to the world and help others to find the way to inner peace. The Adept’s martial prowess makes him a natural champion and protector, but perfection is not bound to any one role. The patience and discipline that mark an Adept’s training make him suitable for a number of callings, from the most repetitive of mindless menial labor to the most arcane and convoluted of intellectual pursuits such as science or philosophy. In this way, the Perfected Adept brings perfection into an imperfect world, making himself an exemplar for others to follow and by which to measure themselves."

He cannot later choose a different Attribute. To gain the boost thereafter, the mage performs an instant action to channel his chi, and his Mind dots are added to the chosen Attribute. The effect lasts for up to one hour per activation. Since this is not a spell, the mage could use this attainment at the same time that he casts a Honing the Form spell to gain a truly phenomenal Attribute rating. The one limitation, however, is that the default Duration of any spell that boosts the same Physical Attribute becomes transitory (one turn), even if it is normally prolonged. Optional Arcanum: Forces 3 If your character also has Forces 3, he can use his chi to strike at a distance, similar to the Forces 3 “Telekinetic Strike”spell (pp. 170-171). An instant action is performed and a Resolve + Brawl + Forces roll is made. Each success inflicts one bashing point of damage. As with the spell, this effect is aimed, so anything that would normally protect the target from a ranged attack applies against the mage’s chi strike."

In addition, he can use his chi to turn aside bullets and other projectiles, similar to the Forces 4 “Control Velocity”spell (p. 172). An instant action is performed and a Dexterity + Brawl + Forces roll is made. The number of successes determines the degree to which he can turn the projectile (as per the spell description).

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "Pygmalion sculpts an image, the perfect Platonic form of woman. He prays. Through his act of will, the unliving image becomes the perfect living form. It’s a romantic conceit. The Pygmalian Society takes this conceit as a manifesto for the transformation of the human race, an allegory for their great work: every Pygmalian strives to be at once artist, artwork and animating force. Art is at the middle of everything. Although the Pygmalian Society’s members’ styles vary, they agree that art, true art, Real Art with a capital “A,” becomes a link to the Supernal World that inspires and alters the human soul. Real Art creates an Awakening — a small, temporary Awakening, sure — but it’s an Awakening. Art is magic. And Magic is Art. The Pygmalians believe that Art is one of the last things that still link the Sleepers to the Supernal realm. True Art — great Art — molds and shapes human history. Great Art inspires people. Great Art incites anger. Great Art provokes action. Every Pygmalian is an artist. The Pygmalians’ magical attainments reflect this. They style themselves as the “Sculptors” of magical reality. They try to imbue every action, every spell they cast, with meaning. As Pygmalians progress, they become their own greatest Artworks. Pygmalians adopt roles. They take on parts, deliberately altering their memories, senses and the way they see things in a search for inspiration — for themselves and others. The Sculptors remake themselves in their own image. They act i their own plays, become the protagonists of their own stories. Through the creation of Art and themselves as Artworks, the Pygmalians seek to effect change. An inspired human soul leads to action, and history takes a new course. These mages recognized from the very beginning that the power of Disbelief stops their magic from altering the world in any but the smallest way, so the Pygmalians work to inspire and change the minds and souls of Sleepers with the power to do the same. Through the Pygmalians’ art, they inspire artists, who in turn have the potential to create something great. The Pygmalians are muses. They’re propagandists. They’re agents provocateur. The true Sculptor is obsessed with the future, but lives in the here and now. A Pygmalian develops the ability to sense the interplay of time and fate in the lives of the people around him, experiencin an intense kind of synesthesia. He can smell pain, hear joy, taste anger. The most talented Pygmalians can se human destinies laid out before them in tastes and colors. These Pygmalians sense the weft and weave of destiny and possibility. Then they embroider with new potentials for inspiration. They want to create a path that the Awakened can travel more easily, at the end of which lies the Awakening of every man, woman and child on the planet. The actual medium of the Pygmalians’ Art is open — any art, high or low, can change things. The Sculptors are obsessed with finding a Holy Grail of true inspiration that will bring about history changing art. Charles Dickens wrote a few works of fiction and ignited Western society’s conscience toward the urban poor. Renaissance painters invented perspective drawing, and a mathematics of space that redefined the world. The writers and translators of the Bible changed the course of human history many times over. Art can be deadly, too. Leni Riefenstahl propagated the sinister glamour that made a nation complicit in the deaths of millions. China’s official TV and newspapers have convinced the most populous nation in the world that the Tiananman Square massacre never happened, that stories of the massacre are just an American plot. Advertising agencies use art to relieve people of their money and leave them in perpetual discontent. Change happens around the Pygmalians. They are not always the direct cause, but they’re always there, nudging things along. People fall in love. Scientists find new insights into the nature of things. Revolutions begin, or end in blood and fire. Whatever the Pygmalians do, they accept no barriers to their Art. With no boundaries, it’s inevitable that some Sculptors go bad. These fallen Pygmalians don’t confine their Art within moral limits. A Pygmalian might commit atrocities to effect the inspiration of a single individual. A Pygmalian’s deeds can easily result in dozens of lives ruined or ended at a single stroke. Love ends more easily than it begins. Even the most noble of revolutions can descend into tyranny. These ruthless mages give the Pygmalian Society the bad reputation it currently suffers among the Awakened. True Pygmalians are much more than the terrorists and instigators of chaos that other mages often believe the Sculptors to be. True Pygmalians are artists, and more than that: they think they know the means by which the entire human race can one day Awaken."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Orders",
				"Text" : "All five of the great mystical orders have Pygmalian members, but more than half of them of the Sculptors end up in the Free Council (if they join an order at all). The first Pygmalians all belonged to the Free Council, and, although the Legacy is not intimately connected to the order, the line of tutor to pupil frequently ensures that new Pygmalians join the Free Council in turn, or belonged to the order in the first place. The Free Council is certainly the order that is most amenable to radical social and intellectual change as a means to Awaken humanity. The less-regulated Free Council is also the order most likely to accept a Pygmalian despite the Legacy’s checkered reputation. The four Atlantean orders all have a few Pygmalians. The Silver Ladder’s stated aim for the Awakening of the human race attracts a fair number of Sculptors, but these mages often find themselves frustrated by the order’s strict and convoluted hierarchy. The Mysterium, with its emphasis on acquiring mystical knowledge, is fairly accommodating, since the Pygmalians are often expert at interpreting the past, connecting it to the present and suggesting implications for the future. Mundane and magical archeology can give the facts about what people did, but an artist’s insight into human emotions can suggest why. Of the old orders, the Guardians of the Veil and the Adamantine Arrow attract the fewest Sculptors. The Guardians don’t generally tolerate the meddling of Pygmalians who try too hard to change human affairs; however, a few of the more subtle Sculptors do find a home among the Guardians. Meanwhile, the Arrows sometimes attract some of the more martially inclined Pygmalians. These Sculptors are respected by other mages within the order, but rarely trusted, and it’s often these Pygmalians who fall into violence as a means of effecting change."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "Like Sleeper artists, Pygmalians are as easy to recognize as they choose to be. Some follow clichés such as the Galois-smoking bohemian with his beret, straight from the Left Bank of Paris, or the intellectual sophisticate clad all in basic black. More Sculptors just look like ordinary, middle-class people. Their manner gives a truer guide. Whoever Sculptors might be, they speak and act passionately. Sometimes, they slide into melodrama that makes cooler-tempered people wince or shake their heads. Subtler mannerisms and an attention to details of the Sculptors’ surroundings make Sleepers think the Sculptors ought to be artists, even if they wear exactly the same clothes as the people standing next to them."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Background",
				"Text" : "Every Pygmalian is an artist with a fair amount of talent and promise. This includes every possible expression of art: novelists, painters, poets, performance artists, musicians, architects, filmmakers, stand-up comedians and DJs are all represented among the Pygmalians. They are not necessarily professional artists. Occasionally, an individual who is not usually considered an artist — a mathematician, a software developer or even a soldier or a politician — joins the Legacy. As long as someone considers what she does to be an art, and is passionate about it, the person is eligible to join. Pygmalians also know their art isn’t enough. Their promise is unfulfilled, and they all want more. Most Pygmalians are just talented enough to realize that they’re not quite talented enough to change the world through their chosen media. They can never reach the supreme heights attained by a Shakespeare, a Rembrandt or a Dante. The Pygmalians offer them an alternative through magic, the Ars Mysteriorum itself."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Organization",
				"Text" : "The Pygmalian Society has little or no formal organization. Pygmalians have no central authority and recognize no precedence other than the respect due teachers from their pupils. Tutors and pupils seem to find each other without trying. Training can vary greatly in intensity and style. One tutor, for example, teaches two or three pupils at a time, holding regular and highly formal classes, where he imparts the mystical knowledge of the tradition in a theoretical, academic form and leaves his pupils to perfect the Legacy’s attainments in their own time, as “homework.” Another tutor disappears from her pupil’s life for weeks on end, turning up apparently according to whim. She spends a few days alongside her pupil, accompanying the less experienced mage through the beginning of each new stage, before vanishing again, leaving the pupil to work out what to do with his new knowledge on his own. Still another tutor demands that he move into his pupil’s home, taking over his unfortunate apprentice’s entire life in order to make a real Sculptor out of her. Whatever the method, all Pygmalian tutors allow their pupils freedom in their choice of Art form (no matter what their personal opinions of its validity as a medium might be). Although it’s common for a tutor to take a pupil who works on the same kind of Art, it’s not universal."

				"Title" : "History",
				"Text" : "The Pygmalian Society has its origins in the Wars of the Roses, a series of schisms and mystical conflicts between a number of mystical groups (particularly Rosicrucians) in 19th-century Paris. The conflict seems unthinkable today, but was widely reported in the Parisian press at the time, since several well-known people of the day were involved. The factions in the “Wars” were mostly composed of Sleepers. A few Awakened were also present, indulging their own schisms and conflicts under cover of the very public and, to them, trivial arguments of their unwitting Sleeper colleagues. One of these mages was Patrice Cajean. Born penniless in Brittany in the late 1860s, Cajean Awakened as a teenager into a nightmare of swirling sounds and colors. By the end of the 1880s, Cajean, through a combination of charm, talent and Awakened magic, reinvented himself as a figure of urbanity and wit. He became a popular figure in the bohemian salons of fin de siècleParis. Through his powers, Cajean was no stranger to the formal mysticism of the Paris sects. He found himself drawn to one particular Rosicrucian splinter group. This group declared that Art was a great mystery, a great empire and a great miracle, and that Artists were hence the secret kings, priests and magicians of the world. Cajean wondered if there was something to this theory. Although he felt contempt for of the importance this faction attached to its petty squabbles, Cajean investigated the possibility that Art was in fact a small form of magic, a link between human beings and the Supernal World (which Cajean, inspired by Neoplatonist philosophy, identified as the Divine Principle, or the Godhead). He posited that when God said, “let there be light,” He created Art through pure inspiration, distilled into creation by an act of will. Cajean investigated ways to harness this true, inspired creativity. He believed he could manipulate human history through Art, planting some ideas and stifling others to weaken the Lie. Just about everyone could appreciate some sort of Art; so Cajean believed he could Awaken everyone through this slender thread connecting their souls to the Supernal World. The project might take a century or more, but an Acanthus mage is not discouraged by time. A few other mages thought Cajean had a good idea. Cajean pictured himself as a new Pygmalion, breathing life into the Fallen World’s lifeless images of the True Forms, so he called his formal and highly ritualized cabal of like-minded mages the Pygmalian Society. His magical program for mass Awakening depended upon communication and control, on ascertaining the intricate web of connections between the soul and other souls, between the soul and the past, present and future. To the Legacy’s existing skill at Fate and Time, the Legacy’s founders added a deep study of Mind, in order to gain a precise knowledge of how the arts could manipulate thoughts and emotions. They had no real plan, though — just a deep faith in the transformative power of Art. Cajean’s first pupil, Marcus Naismith, was an Englishman. He brought the Pygmalian Society into the English-speaking world. Naismith’s own take on the Legacy’s magic was influenced by his great love of the philosophy and art of the visionary poet and engraver William Blake. English-speak-ing Pygmalians in particular have used Blakean language to describe their magic and rituals ever since. A member of the Society last saw Patrice Cajean alive in March of 1916. Right up to the end of his life, Cajean felt the need to live among the ordinary people he longed to see reunited with the Godhead. He believed a Supernal inspiration brought the human race to the Great War: patriotic fervor and the need to prove the courage of nations led the entire world into a storm of death, plague and famine. Cajean knew the Great War would shatter the age of European colonial empires, with possibilities for great Good and terrifying Evil opening up through the rest of the century. The idealistic mage hoped to avert the horrors of the Great War and its aftermath, but could not stand to hide in a secure sanctum far from harm. He needed to share the danger and the struggle. Cajean failed; he died in the fighting at Verdun, wearing the face of a man 30 years his junior. In the years after the Great War, the Pygmalian Society fragmented. Without Cajean’s charisma to temper the remaining founders’ personal quarrels, they drifted apart. Art was changing, too. New movements such as futurism, cubism, and Dada brought new ideas and new Pygmalians who had little time for a structured organization. They preferred to use the Legacy in their own way. By World War II, “Pygmalians” had ceased to be anything more than a catch-all term for those mages who crafted their souls in the tradition of Patrice Cajean, and the Pygmalians have resisted formal organization ever since. Their methods and Art have changed, but they still hold true to Patrice Cajean’s faith in the Supernal power of Art."

				"Text" : "The first principles of the Pygmalian Society grew out of Western occult traditions. Although most Pygmalians don’t dress up their magic in the formal principles of Rosicrucian practice any more, the study of their attainments shows the influence of a very European style of mysticism, with a special nod to William Blake. They still use much of Patrice Cajean’s language. Most Pygmalians still refer to the Supernal as the “Godhead,” for example; they call their goal of universal Awakening the “Reconciliation,” or the “Marriage of Heaven and Hell.” As a corollary, most Pygmalians practice European styles of creative Art. Awakened artists representing non-Western artistic forms (such as African woodcarving, for example, or Japanese verse) seldom find their way into the Pygmalian Society. If such artists-mages do get the opportunity to join, it’s generally because they try to practice their art in a Western context; for example, a member of a group of Indian musicians performing in New York state art centers. Apart from the relationship between tutors and their pupils, Pygmalians aren’t known for working together. They don’t hold to any network, and they don’t recognize any obligations to each other above and beyond that normally expected because of membership in a cabal or a mystical order. As Artists, the Pygmalians have more than their fair share of self-publicists in their number. They tend to become well known among the mystical orders, particularly among Consilii in Western Europe and in urbanized areas of the United States. Many more mages hear about Pygmalian mages than actually meet them. Unfortunately, the greatest self-publicists among the Pygmalians are often those who went wrong. Many mages who know about Pygmalians by reputation don’t even realize that they’re Artists, and imagine instead that they are a Legacy of terrorists or lunatics. The wide variation among the methods and styles of the Pygmalians often means that this assessment goes unchallenged. Most Sculptors don’t care in the end what other mages think. The nature of the Sculptors’ goal is such that they care more about the Sleepers, anyway. A Pygmalian mage surrounds herself with Sleepers — talented, passionate people who achieve more than simple talk, never art-school poseurs. She does her absolute level best to become a conduit of inspiration for the extraordinary people around her. At best, a Sculptor tries to drive her companions to create something special, something fantastic. It’s not the mage’s own role to change things. No great invention or epochmaking artwork has ever been made by a mage: it’s the way that the Fallen World works. The Pygmalians recognize that this is the Sleepers’ world, and the Sleepers have to change it. The credit for great art never belongs to the Sculptor. All he does is attempt to contribute through magic and other arts to an environment where genius can flourish; creation can occur only through inspiration. Simply to give ideas to an artist is not enough. True genius can work with secondhand materials (you only need to look at the work of Shakespeare and Mozart to see that), but great artists transform their sources in unique, inspired ways. What the Sculptor tries to do is simply be there and guide his Artists to find the Godhead themselves. He’s a lover, a companion, a patron, a friend, sometimes a rival or an enemy. Sometimes, loneliest of all, he’s an unattainable figure in the distance that haunts his Artists’ steps. Whatever role he takes, he’s a muse and a catalyst for the real Artist and the real work. The Pygmalian’s goal is to create the conditions through which the Reconciliation can happen. Any incursion of magic, any minor half-Awakening is enough. It doesn’t matter if there isn’t a specific plan as such. If enough of these small victories are won, the mages of the Pygmalian Society are confident that, one day, the Marriage of Heaven and Hell will take place and everyone will Awaken."

				"Text" : "Art is a dangerous thing. The Pygmalian Society recognizes this, but, at the same time, the Legacy’s lack of organization means that the group has no checks and balances. The freedom of its members to find any way at all to create art can become a trap of Hubris. While fallen Pygmalians have been few, a Sculptor gone wrong can have a terrible influence on the world around her. These fallen Sculptors are Jonahs. Chaos surrounds them. When they’re nearby, relationships collapse. Families tear apart. Cars crash. Crops fail. Diseases break out. Buildings explode. Riots erupt. Governments lose their grip. Wars start. People die. The most notorious of these Sculptors was Enoch Christopher, a Welsh poet who joined the Pygmalian Society in 1936. Christopher, influenced by the futurists, composed puzzling non-linear works that, thanks to his mastery of Pygmalian magic, held his manifesto encoded within them: true inspiration requires conflict. Anger, grief and terror open artists to Supernal truth and goad them to the heights of self-expression. Christopher believed that if his Art was to have any chance of bringing about real transformation, the Art had to be unfettered by any limits of scale or morality. This manifesto of change through violence has cropped up, quite independently, on a number of occasions. These Pygmalians might not openly say so to begin with, but they share the assumption that human beings are just raw clay for the Sculptor’s Art. Some Sculptors begin to directly manipulate lives. The more powerful among them tear up human memories and put them back together like a Burroughsian cut-up, using trauma to drive their victims to action. Some Pygmalians become equally cavalier with themselves. They alter their own minds, messing with everything from taste in clothes right through to sexual orientation, even temporarily rebuilding their own memories in order to becometheir grand Artwork and, through the inspiration they gain, alter the world. It’s not healthy to become close to Pygmalians who works like this. Everything goes wrong around them, as they engineer conflict in their own lives. They manipulate people around them to create lovers, enemies, tragedies, accidents and obstacles to overcome — often without even informing themselves that they’re doing it. For instance, a Sculptor creates an alternate personality to fall in love, then the master personality kills the lover so the other self can experience true loss. Enoch Christopher himself died in the late 1980s, a notorious harbinger of disaster. He had become possibly the best-known Pygmalian who had ever lived, almost singlehandedly responsible for the Pygmalian Society’s bad name. The original manuscript copy of Christopher’s 1939 collection of “automatic poetry,” When I Came Back It Was Gone, still exists and is a powerful, spontaneously generated Artifact in its own right. The revisions and alterations contained in this sheaf of yellowing paper hold frightening secrets and great power along with cold, brutal resonance."

				"Title" : "Induction",
				"Text" : "The Pygmalian Society sets few requirements for its members. Pygmalians are Awakened and Artists. All have that desire, that need, to make a powerful difference to creation. The Pygmalians have no hard rules for choosing their pupils. Some Pygmalians seek particular individuals; others wait for pupils to come to them. Time seems to play tricks on new Pygmalians, and many even experience their first initiation before deciding to join the order, or even knowing that they’re being initiated — which is just as well, since, given the Legacy’s terrible reputation, very few mages would actually join without some kind of revelation as to what the Pygmalian Society really is. In his induction, the mage enters a deep coma. Initiation plays out as a hyper-real dream in which the mage, placed in the surroundings of his mind’s eye, is forced to undergo an ordeal of some kind. Ordeals vary, but they are always deadly serious, and sometimes just deadly: the new Pygmalian might have to endure what seems like a week-long ritual dance, survive a crucifixion or experience being tattooed all over his body. In the ordeal, the Pygmalian is guided or hindered (or both) by a visionary figure who will return in each of the Pygmalian’s initiatory ordeals. Sometimes, this figure is a mirror image of the Pygmalian, a past self or a potential future self. Sometimes, the guide is a sexual complement of the Pygmalian, a perfect “other half” of the opposite gender to the initiate (or, if the initiate is gay, the same gender). Sometimes, the guide is an entirely different figure, perhaps one of the regular cast of the initiate’s dreams elevated to the position of spokesperson. Sometimes, the guide is a mythical or literary figure: anything from a Grail-questing knight to a talking animal that leads the mage down a rabbit hole. When the ordeal is over, the Pygmalian returns to consciousness and the real world. There is always some anomaly that suggests that the ordeal was not a dream. A Pygmalian who endures being tattooed wakes up with a small tattoo on her face. A Pygmalian who endures crucifixion in his vision wakes up with small scars on his hands, feet and sides. Another Pygmalian finds small objects or items of jewellery belonging to her mage’s guide in her pockets. On the other hand, a Pygmalian who fails his initiation usually has no memory of what happened, and is likely to be found very ill, or with broken bones or just covered from head-to-toe with bruises or superficial burns. Although every Pygmalian tutor teaches his pupils in his own way, the substance of the teaching is fairly constant: pupils are taught the Pygmalian philosophy of Art. At the same time, Pygmalian pupils receive absolute freedom with what they do with the teaching, how they express their Art and whom they choose to guide in turn. In each subsequent initiation, the Pygmalian undergoes another hallucinatory ordeal, and, each time, gains another sign that the ordeal was more than simply a dream. These dream-ordeals, however, are not spontaneous unless the Sculptor has cut her tie to her tutor and decided to craft her soul without further help. Soulcrafting for the second and third attainments involves a preparatory ritual. Each tutor and pupil design a unique ritual to induce the initiatory vision, but the ceremony uses paraphernalia drawn from Western magical traditions. Depending on the tutor, this could involve robes or nakedness, magic circles, wands, knives and the like. Shortly before Cajean’s death, he underwent a fourth ordeal. He told one of his pupils that he had learned the truth about where these visions came from and who the visionary figures really are. He died before he could lead anyone else to the fourth attainment. If any other Pygmalians have reached the fourth ordeal by themselves, they’ve kept quiet about what they learned."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Induction Before Choice",
				"Text" : "Many Pygmalians say they had their initiatory ordeal before they decided to join the Legacy, and their initiatory ordeal guided them to their tutors. That’s only partly accurate: Acanthus mages take a free and easy view of Time, but even they don’t engage in rampant causality violation. Unconsciously, an Acanthus mage’s soul can see the possible futures and the option of joining the Pygmalians. The soul induces the initiatory coma; mind and soul have their dialogue and reach a conclusion. The soulcrafting is not complete, however. Unless the nascent Pygmalian has a Gnosis of 4 or higher, he still needs a tutor’s help to “lock in” his soul’s new shape. "

Many mages are surprised that the powers the Pygmalians cultivate above all others are so indirect. The Pygmalians work to master Time and Fate, like other Acanthus, but add to this a superior understanding of the mysteries of Mind. Through this Arcanum, they manipulate emotion, sense and memory for the purpose of guiding others to their own inspiration. Pygmalian magic is subtle, hidden in passionate words or flamboyant gestures that are not obviously magical in and of themselves. Many Pygmalians, particularly those who perform in some way, learn how to use their Art as a vehicle for their magic (especially for extended spellcasting). The most talented Pygmalians learn to do this themselves, even before they join the Legacy. ",

				"Description" : "The first thing the aspiring Pygmalian learns is how to direct emotions through the manipulation of human senses. Smells, sounds, tastes and colors — or their implanted memories — can alter someone’s mood for good or ill, reminding a subject or a group of people of whatever emotion the mage wants them to experience. This attainment produces an effect more or less identical to the Mind 2 rote “Sculpt the Heart” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 208), but using a contested roll of Manipulation + Expression + Mind versus the subject’s Composure + Gnosis. The mage’s own senses are affected too. By examining the sensory reflection of the emotions dredged up from his subjects’ memories, the mage can perceive the weave of connections existing between the people he affects and the people around them. The links of emotion and Fate manifest as a kind of synesthesia, with emotional smells, tastes, sounds or colors becoming apparent to the mage as he examines the web of association around him. In game terms, this works as the Fate 1 spell “Interconnections” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 148). As a minor side effect, the mage permanently becomes a synesthete, with tastes, colors, smells and sounds mixed up in his perceptions. Many Pygmalians see this as a benefit, citing Shakespeare and Kandinsky as examples of inspiration through synesthesia. The mage can bring about the memory of feeling through simple conversation, or through the medium of his Art (for example, by means of a musical performance, a stand-up gig or a gallery showing at which the mage is present). The effect does not always have to be direct. Calming words can, for example, be used to hide an infuriating subtext (in the manner of a “friends, Romans, countrymen” speech). If they can, Pygmalians use this power on groups of people rather than individuals, since the more people the Pygmalians can affect, the more information they can glean about their interconnections. Sometimes, a Pygmalian uses this power on herself. She might feel she needs to force herself to do something frightening or emotionally painful. She might want to make herself play a role with true sincerity, or she could simply want to feel something. Even though the mage uses this power on a willing subject (i.e., herself), she still makes a reflexive roll of Composure + Gnosis to resist; the mage might be willing, but, subconsciously, her soul perceives this as an intrusion and fights back. The mage can, however, reduce her resistance dice pool by spending Mana, thus suppressing her natural reactions with magical brute force: each point of Mana spent reduces the Composure + Gnosis pool by 1."

				"Description" : "The Pygmalians develop their understanding of sensory and emotional manipulation further by learning how to imbue their actions or their performances with complex meaning. This works in a manner similar to the Mind 3 rote “Bricks of Babel” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 213), but using a roll of Intelligence + Expression + Mind. Pygmalians who achieve this second attainment can communicate complex concepts and messages in a few brief, insignificant movements, or say one thing and communicate something completely different to the recipient. The mage can choose whether to communicate his message to an individual or to a group (use the modifiers for casting spells on more than one target; see Mage: The Awakening p. 118); the mage can also choose whether the recipients of the message actually realize that they’ve received a message from him, rather than simply having thoughts pop into their heads. The second attainment can be used in conjunction with the first. After succeeding with an application of Arrows of Desire, the mage’s player makes another roll to apply the first attainment to the message. If the roll is successful, the message has the added effect of affecting the recipient’s emotions. A skillful and lucky Pygmalian who uses the second attainment and the first in quick succession can move crowds of people to believe nearly anything. However, these attainments do not work over radio, television or recorded media — the Sculptor must be “live and in person.” Optional Arcanum: Time 3 Pygmalians realize that they often make mistakes, and that sometimes brushstrokes need to be erased or altered. Sometimes, a Pygmalian needs to know the immediate results of two or three choices. A Pygmalian mage who is also a Disciple of Time can fold herself into her own short-term memory, bodily pulling herself moments into the past in the same way as the Time 3 spell, “Shifting Sands” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 263). A Pygmalian knowing this spell or ancillary attainment often repeats it, over and over, as he examines all the possible results of his decisions. This can be dangerous, since, similar to the “Shifting Sands” spell, anything that happens to the mage still happens, because the mage, in going back, actually displaces his earlier self from the timestream. Sculptors who do this often may experience strange sensations at entirely random intervals, shuddery, cold sort of feelings, like sudden flashbacks of dying."

				"Description" : "Pygmalians who reach the third attainment find that, while the secret of inspiration is still, frustratingly, just out of their grasp, they can, at the very least, produce the conditions for revelation to happen. Through the manipulation of memory, a mage with this attainment can make a single subject experience an epiphany, a sudden understanding of some past event, or a false memory of some inspirational, life-changing experience. Depending on the event the mage chooses, this experience can be healing or traumatic. In game terms, this works like the Mind 4 spell “Breach the Vault of Memory” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 214) with the same contested roll of Gnosis + Mind versus the subject’s Resolve + Gnosis. The revelation doesn’t last very long (usually no more than a scene — see the spell description in Mage: The Awakening, then apply the number of successes rolled to the Extended Spellcasting Duration chart for prolonged spells on p. 120 of that book), but the revelation’s indirect effects last. Even when the subject recognizes that her memories of love, divine revelation or childhood trauma were delusions, she still recalls what it felt like to remember these things. The memory of feeling is not feeling, but often is enough to drive a creative individual to cathartic action. A novelist given a taste of bitter love writes a powerful story of loss and desire. A painter is driven to a masterpiece by the memory of a unique face. Pygmalians often bolster the effect, repeating it or prolonging it with the use of the first and second attainments. Pygmalians also use this power on themselves. Again, a Sculptor might want believe utterly in his adopted role or experience someone else’s trauma, or even to experience that madness said to be close to genius. Similar to the first attainment, a Pygmalian using this power on himself still has to make a reflexive resistance roll, this time Resolve + Gnosis (per “Breach the Vault of Memory”). He can spend Mana to force the power on himself. Pygmalians using this power often have no idea what they’re doing when under their own influence. Some Pygmalians can even take on three entirely separate roles in a day, all the time unaware of the actions of their other selves. Optional Arcanum: Time 4 An Adept of Time who achieves the power to impart Eternity in an Hour gains a small revelation of his own. By examining the skeins of fate and time connecting everything, the Pygmalian can discern what needs to happen in order for any individual to create history, or True Art — or stop it from happening. This works exactly like the Time 4 spell, “Prophecy” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 264). The answer is never direct. It comes as a feeling, an emotion, supplemented by synesthetic sensory experiences (heard colors, tasted sounds). The mage, thinking over the options, suddenly knows what feelsright, and takes the opportunity to act on that intuition."

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "Ideologues from all of the five orders refer to the curse that prevents Sleepers from understanding and remembering magic as “Quiescence.” For years, mages decried this phenomenon — it was a victory for the Exarchs, it was preventing humanity from ascending and Awakening, and it caused potentially lethal Paradoxes. It prevented mages from using their skills to humanity’s greatest benefit. In the aftermath of the Second World War, three mages realized, grudgingly, that Quiescence might have another, beneficial function. It kept mages separate from Sleepers so that Sleepers could manage the world in their own way. Maybe the Abyss was there for a reason? These three mages were all comrades in arms, having served in France. One of them, Ellis Weaver, was wounded in battle and returned home before the end of the war. Another, George West, was promoted and rode out the war in command bunkers, rather than in the field. The last, Hans “Johnny” Dorfmann, stayed in the field and was present when US forces liberated the Dachau concentration camp in 1945. When they reunited after the war, they drank and talked and laughed, and finally, after several bottles of bourbon, someone said what they were thinking: Humanity was leaving magic behind. Magic was powerful and amazing, but it was slow, and everything that the three of them could see pointed to the future being all about speed, efficiency and mass production. They could work within that system, they felt, or they could live forever outside of it. That night saw the beginnings of the Quiescent, a Legacy devoted not to the destruction of magic or its removal from the world, but to the practice of magic that would work withinthe Fallen World. Their magic would be invisible, explainable as coincidence, guiding rather than forcing. Yes, it would be challenging, and yes, they would be leaving behind some of their most impressive abilities. But they would also be safer. As paranoia grew in the wake of the brewing Cold War, the three of them were even more convinced that they were right. Over the next few years, the three of them trained other mages in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit in their philosophy. They inducted a few into the Legacy, once they were sure that the subject was ready to leave behind the quick power and flashy results that vulgar magic brought. Their philosophy and magical style, known as Quiet magic, proved more popular (and, obviously, easier to adopt than the Legacy), and other mages began spreading it. Entire Quiet cabals, known as “Whispering” or “Sotto Voce” cabals, arose, but the Consilii to which they belong rarely had a sense of who they were or what they were doing. As such, they gained a reputation as being untrustworthy, maybe even Seer plants. This, in turn, drove the Quiet mages even further from the mainstream of mage society."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Schism",
				"Text" : "In 1948, Hans Dorfmann split from the cabal. In his letter to his friends, he claimed that it wasn’t working. It wasn’t enough to work magic invisibly. Magic needed to stop. With horror, George and Ellis realized that Hans had become a Banisher. Within three weeks, more than 20 Quiet mages across the country were dead. Hans couldn’t possibly have killed them all, or so his former cabal-mates thought — not unless he was using his mastery of Space magic to transport himself around. Ellis and George contacted as many of their followers as they could, but part of the Quiet philosophy was a focus on avoiding easy detection. As such, by the time they could make contact with many potential targets, they were already dead. Wracked with guilt, the two of them stepped back from Awakened society in 1950. Many practitioners of the Quiet philosophy, though, never having actually met the three founders, were perfectly safe (at least from Hans). They went about their lives in the bleak years of the late 1940s, attempting to live in harmony with the direction that the Sleepers seemed to be taking the world."
			}, {
				"Title" : "The Quiet Philosophy",
				"Text" : "As mentioned in the text above, the most important principle of the Quiet philosophy is that the mage use no vulgar magic. Every spell the mage casts must be in keeping with the natural laws of the Fallen World. That means that the mage should have some grounding in physics and probably other scientific fields as well, and Quiet mentors often counsel their pupils not to rely on the propensity of Sleepers to shrug off weird occurrence. Yes, Sleeper witnesses might say, “it could happen,” but magic does not occur in a vacuum. The Abyss is always watching. Beyond that, however, the Quiet philosophy doesn’t ask much. Mages aren’t expected to follow precepts of non-violence, beneficence or honesty. The founders did endorse living in the Fallen World and not pretending it was something other than it was. Mages have the same choices and opportunities as Sleepers, and sometimes that means taking the dirty money or pulling the trigger. As might be expected, some mages take the wrong lessons from Quiet. It’s easy to hear “do what you have to do” and see that as “do anything you want.” This is one reason that Quiet mages have bad reputations in many Consilii. Fortunately, another important precept of Quiet is keeping one’s head down and staying out of sight of the authorities, both Sleeper and Awakened."

Their first pupils formed a cabal which remained active into the 1950s (and is detailed in the Appendix to this book), but their whereabouts after that point are unknown. It is probable that, as the paranoia of the 1940s and 1950s gave way to the radicalism of the 1960s, the philosophy simply became outmoded and unpopular. The Legacy, of course, was harder to shed, and so it is likely that a few Liars still live today."

A nosy mage attempting to use Time magic on a Quiescent mage finds the attempt frustrated — instead of seeing the target’s past, she sees simply a swirl of shadow and hears a rush of sound, with noform or detail. Likewise, police investigation into the character’s past hits walls. People don’t remember the character, records go missing, and photos never quite look like the mage. In game terms, this Attainment functions much like the Shield of Chronos spell (p. 261 of Mage: The Awakening; consider the Potency to be equal to the Liar’s Gnosis) except that it is always active and it applies to mundane investigations into the character’s past as well as inquisitive uses of Time magic. This Attainment stacks with uses of Shield of Chronos."

				"Description" : "It’s not enough to be a man without a past if someone can just come and find you (particularly when one of the Legacy’s founders is trying to kill you). This attainment, originally designed to help the Liars avoid scrutiny from the Sleeper authorities, has the added benefit of helping to thwart Hans’ lethal attentions (see p. 21). This Attainment allows the Liar to instinctively avoid detection by knowing when and where someone might be waiting for him. The player activates this Attainment by rolling Wits + Stealth + Time. Once active, the Attainment remains in effect for one day. While active, the character cannot be ambushed or surprised. If he encounters a situation in which someone is looking for him with baleful intent, he feels a creeping sensation on the back of his neck or in the pit of his stomach. This doesn’t mean he can’t or shouldn’t enter the situation anyway, and in fact some Quiescent mages state that this Attainment just gives them a warning that things are about to go badly, not a way to avoid such situations. In game terms, the Storyteller should tell the player when the character is about to enter a scene in which someone is lying in wait, but not be more specific than that. What awaits the character might be as simple as an ex-wife’s lawyer wanting to serve papers, or as dangerous as a gangster’s thug waiting to plug the Liar. If the character turns and leaves, he’ll never know the nature of the threat (though of course, the mage could also cast Divination for more information). If the character does enter the situation, the player is considered to automatically succeed on any Reaction to Surprise roll (see p. 46 of the World of Darkness Rulebook). Optional Arcanum: Death 3 Everything breaks if you hit it with enough force. Liars with some skill in the Death Arcanum learn to apply their magic to this principle. With the expenditure of one point of Mana, the player can add the mage’s Gnosis to any roll made to damage or destroy an inanimate object, provided the mage does not use vulgar magic to do so. This allows Liars to kick in sturdy doors, shoot out the engine blocks of oncoming cars, and ram their own vehicles through roadblocks."

				"Description" : "The future is a phantom. Any reasonable predictions about where humanity as a species was going evaporated along with nearly 80,000 citizens in the wake of the bombing of Hiroshima. The only future worth discussing is tomorrow—not the “tomorrow” that science fiction writers insist will bring flying cars and world peace, but the day after today. This Attainment allows the Quiescent to manipulate the immediate future to their benefit. Roll Manipulation + Science + Time, and spend one point of Mana. If the roll succeeds, the player may narrate one beneficial change in circumstance for her character. The more elaborate the change, though, the longer it takes. A change in circumstance that helps her win a fight (the enemy runs out of bullets, the cops arrive) might only take a turn, whereas one that changes the mage’s life entirely (becoming fabulously wealthy, finding true love) might take years. In play, the best use of this Attainment is one that the player can clearly define and that is doesn’t “break” the narrative, so the Storyteller has full veto rights. Since so few mages have or ever will have access to this Attainment, the full scope of the power it grants is unknown. Optional Arcanum: Death 4 Applying knowledge of weak points isn’t limited to inanimate objects. A Quiet mage with this level of skill can find the weak point in a living being, applying potentially fatal force to an attack. The player spends one point of Mana to add the mage’s Gnosis to an attack. The attack can take any mundane form (punch, stab, gunshot) but cannot be magically enhanced in any way. A humane mage can use this power to knock out troublesome opponents quickly. A less humane mage can walk into a room with a gun and kill everyone in it in a few seconds."

				"Text" : "Almost every civilization has a “time before” story. Before life was the way it was, there was a paradise, a land of ease and comfort, of beauty and pleasure. And then, usually due to some failing on the part of mankind, it all fell apart, and people were forced to hunt, mate, hurt and die. The fact that this myth is so widespread leads the Awakened to surmise that there must be some truth to it — indeed, they tie these uber-myths to their own story of the Fall of Atlantis. The Celestial Ladder shattered and the Awakened City was lost forever. The Orders of the Pentacle (rather, four of them) claim to be all that remains of this “time before.” The Roses of Eden don’t dispute this. They just think it’s pathetic. The Roses of Eden are mages that denounce the Pentacle, and the Atlantean paradigm in general. It is n’t t h at t hey cla im At la nt is neve r ex is t e d — c e r t a in ly the temples and Artifacts, to say nothing of phenomena such as ananke, indicate that somecivilization of mages predated known history. What the Roses object to is basing the current, modern-day society of the Awakened on a society about which so few concrete facts are known. After all, mages are aware that the Seers of the Throne take their orders (or at least inspiration) from ancient, ascended masters — why, then, do the Pentacle mages insist on doing the same thing? Oracles or Exarchs, it doesn’t matter. Both are inscrutable, both are unknowable, and both are not of the Fallen World. Better, surely, to create a new society, one truly born of the modern era. The Legacy’s members are aware that their philosophies aren’t popular, and so most of them try to meet other mages’ concerns as reasonably and gently as possible. This is especially true of the Noddists, who once claimed membership in one of the orders but left after the labyrinthine politics and rampant nepotism disillusioned them. Yes, the orders have safeguarded important secrets through the centuries — rotes, magical practices, mudras, mystic items and locations — and those should all be preserved. But isn’t it time to cast off the rivalries of the past? Some Noddists, however, are openly hostile to the orders. They might be able to work with order mages, or even to join their cabals, but they refuse to take membership. Some even refuse to claim membership in a Consilium, but most Roses admit that it just isn’t practical to try to make a life as a mage without the protection and support of other mages. Perhaps most controversial of all, some Roses cultivate contact with sorcerers whose power doesn’t come from the Supernal Realms at all. Not all magic is Awakened in nature, and while most mages seem to feel that any magic that doesn’t directly stem from an Awakening is an inferior or even stolen version of their own power, the Roses of Eden view all magic as having a place in their ideal society. The Fallen World is a dangerous place, and having allies that don’t suffer Paradox or engender Disbelief can only benefit the Awakened, even if their powers aren’t as versatile. The Roses of Eden haven’t made a great deal of progress toward establishing their society yet, largely because they have thousands of years of Atlantean tradition to break through. In some Consilii (notably those with a heavy Free Council presence), the Roses have succeeded in doing away with some of the tradition offices. Instead of a Hierarch, a visiting cabal might find a Committee, or even a President, elected for a short time by the mages of the city. Rumor has it that one city’s mages even collectively renounced their order membership and pledged themselves to the Roses of Eden. This city (the exact location varies depending on who is telling the tale and why) lost all of its mages over the next six weeks, and now no Consilium at all remains. The more militant Roses of Eden have their theories about what really happened, but the moderate members of the Legacy doubt the veracity of the story."
			}, {
				"Title" : "History",
				"Text" : "The story goes that in Eden, before the fall from grace, roses did not have thorns. After Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, God laid a curse on Adam that (among other things) plants would have thorns and thistles. Roses, then, developed the sharp thorns that would go on to become metaphors for life in general and for the sorrow that seems to follow happiness. This story resonated with an Acanthus mage named Abigail Mitchum who had recently joined the Silver Ladder. During her Awakening to Arcadia, she had seen the possibility of the Wise to earn the title, to delve into mysteries of the past and look to the heart of history’s greatest triumphs and mistakes. The potential to teach, to save and to succor was there, in the Awakened soul of every mage. The Silver Ladder, she was told when she emerged, breathless, from her Awakening, was the society of kings, the shining beacon of…. This sort of talk continued until she’d pledged herself to the order. But then, slowly but surely, she learned that others didn’t share her idealism. Abigail was a veteran of bureaucracy, both from civil service jobs and academia, and she recognized what she was seeing. The Wise, the Awakened, the all-powerful théarchs, weren’t looking beyond their own interests. They saw status within the orders as a goal in itself. Frustrated, she made friends with members of the other orders, and discovered that it was the same everywhere. Even in the Free Council, which didn’t suffer from the same kind of pettiness, mages still saw clout within their own society as a goal. Abigail thought that was absurd. Yes, people have a tendency to seek accolades, and they could still do good things while gaining status. But mage society was artificial, constructed around and in the cracks of Sleeper society as some desperate homage to a time that no living mage could verify, much less remember. Abigail held the Awakened to a higher standard than that, and dramatically left the Silver Ladder. “It’s not enough for her to be a mage,” one of her former colleagues muttered as she left. “She wants to be a superhero.” Abigail dropped out of sight and ventured across the world, meeting with order leaders, new cabals, solitary mages and those rare few who exist outside the Atlantean societal structure. She learned that there were other ways of doing magic. Power over the world could come from many sources, not all of them benign. A man’s burning obsession could create life. A witch’s potions could make someone fall in love. A wolf-skin, properly prepared, could allow a man to change into a beast. What Abigail took away from these meetings, aside from a great deal of arcane knowledge, was that either magic infused the Fallen World to a much greater degree than mages understood, or that they just weren’t willing to admit it. And again, Abigail found that unacceptable. She returned to her original Consilium five years to the day after she left. She approached the seat of the Hierarch and threw a thornless rose at his feet, and then turned to face the assembled Awakened. “I am the Rose of Eden,” she said, “and I have shed my thorns. Anyone who wants to do so is welcome to find me.” A few of the mages in attendance did, in fact, come to see her, but only those on the Path of Thistle have so far joined the Legacy itself. Over the ensuing years, the Roses of Eden have spread out over the world, sometimes working closely with Consilium mages, sometimes shunning them and keeping company with other solitaries and non-Awakened sorcerers."

				"Title" : "Induction",
				"Text" : "Once a prospect has found a potential tutor, she must present her case. Why should she be allowed to join the Legacy? Wanting to keep membership in any of the four Atlantean orders (or “pseudo-Atlantean” orders, as some Roses call them) is grounds for immediate dismissal. Individual Noddists can choose to admit Free Council mages to their ranks, but not all are willing to do so. Only Acanthus mages are permitted to become Roses of Eden. The prospect is subjected to lengthy questioning, and all answers are vetted against both mundane and magical investigation. The Roses like to know who they are dealing with. It isn’t that they are afraid of infiltration (they tend to be transparent about their agendas and initiatives), just that they don’t want people grubbing for power within the Legacy. The prospect also needs to present an accounting of what she has done with her life. Has she held down jobs or raised a family, or has she led a life of hedonism and sloth? The Legacy doesn’t disapprove of pleasure, but the Roses can’t abide idleness from mages. Recently Awakened mages, especially those who have careers and families and are still coping with the transition from Sleeping life to Awakened life, are never turned away, even if they can’t actually join the Legacy (due to not being Acanthus or not being magically powerful enough). Such people are given support and mentoring, always with an eye toward building the ideal Awakened society — one in which mages help each other to explore the secrets of the world and protect those who cannot safely look upon those secrets, rather than squirreling them away and sniggering about it. The Roses of Eden don’t go in for showy initiation requirements. They see such trials as exactly the sort of thing that mages should be able to rise above. After all, a mage with even the barest knowledge of the Mind or Fate Arcana should know a lie when she hears one. An Apprentice of Time can get a sense as to whether a given prospect will or will not make a good member of the Legacy. Why not put these talents to use, and save the time that would otherwise be wasted in contests of strength, skill or political savvy — talents that can just as easily be bestowed by magic? The gifts of Awakened are nothing without the moral fiber to make good use of them, and if there is a spell to make someone into a reasonable and honest person, the Roses haven’t discovered it yet. Once a mage is accepted into the Legacy, she is expected to keep regular contact with her mentor for a period of not less than sixth months. During that time, she is also expected to act in some meaningful way, either to help other mages reinvent their society, help Sleepers combat the evils of theirsociety, or find mages and other magic users outside the Atlantean power structure and enlist their help, or at least their knowledge. All of these can be dangerous jobs, and the Roses of Eden make no bones about it — they do not enjoy the same support that other mages do. “But,” Abigail always says when this is pointed out to her, “give the Roses time to bloom.”"

One might look at the Legacy as a way to forcibly bring down the established Consilium structure, and recruit a mage with experience in urban warfare. Another might take a more tolerant approach and try to bring the system down by exposing it — a reporter, then, might make for a good pupil. As a faction or an ideological movement, the Roses of Eden don’t discriminate. Sleepwalkers, non-Awakened sorcerers and even order mages (though they aren’t usually made to feel very welcome) can expect to be heard when the Roses gather."

As with many Legacies, pupils and mentors stay in contact after they have parted ways, and in this manner the Noddists keep each other appraised of current events.

The Awakened have been cast down, and the remaining shreds of the Atlantean society simply need to be ground up and discarded like the trash they are. Add to this a kind of brutal naturalistic bent, and it’s easy to see the Roses as the creeping vines (with thorns, of course) that grow over disused property. The first Attainment of the Legacy remains unchanged. The primary function of the Tree of Life Attainment likewise remains the same, but the optional Arcanum becomes Fate 3, with the following power: The mage curses a piece of food, usually fruit or some other plant. It’s even possible to curse a tree or other fruit-bearing plant and affect every morsel of food on it, though this curse only lasts for a scene, while cursing an individual piece of food lasts until the food is eaten or rots. Laying the curse requires a roll of Manipulation + Occult + Fate. When someone consumes the cursed item, he is plagued with ill fortune. Over the course of the next week, the Storyteller can designate some of the target’s rolls to be chance rolls, no matter what the usual dice pools. These rolls must be Mental action in nature; combat rolls are exempt, but rolls such as Research, Perception and Reaction to Surprise are eligible. The number of chance rolls is equal to the Noddist’s Fate Arcanum. The third Attainment remains as written, including the optional Arcanum. The experience becomes much more painful and invasive, and participants might find moss growing under their fingernails after it is over."

Some Consilii regard the Legacy as nothing less than a terrorist organization, and it’s not unknown for assassins to target the Noddists, especially the ones that seem to make some headway (ironically, the loud, hyper-critical Roses are the easiest to ignore, and seldom get selected for termination). In any event, after the third attempt by the Guardians of the Veil to silence her, Abigail developed a spell allowing her to sense minute changes in plant life around her. This enabled her to sense assassins coming before they could drive in the knife, and, surprisingly, even warned her of magical attacks. The plant kingdom, it seems, responds to shifts in the flow of Mana in ways that animals (humans included) can’t fathom. In game terms, this Attainment is always active and mimics the effects of both “Pulse of the Living World” and “Analyze Life” (p. 181 and 180 of Mage: The Awakening, respectively). The character thus always has an active Mage Sight, and can, with a reflexive Intelligence + Science or Animal Ken roll, know the age, sex and species of a living thing. This also has the handy effect of detecting when something is not alive, which is useful for sniffing out undead creatures, something Abigail used to great effect when looking for vampiric sorcerers. In addition, the mage is constantly tuned in to the minu t e s h ift s in t he p at t e r n s o f life a r o u n d he r. I n g a me terms, this adds two dice to any reaction to surprise roll (see p. 46 of the World of Darkness Rulebook).

				"Description" : "Right or wrong, people respond better to those who appear healthy, strong and attractive. Abigail noted early in her campaign that if she looked well-rested and hale, her audiences, be they mage, Sleeper or stranger beings still, received her politely and with more respect. This Attainment allows a Noddist to appear perpetually healthy, with the bonus of allowing her to heal damage to her body more quickly into the bargain, by combining her knowledge of plant life with her ability to heal herself. The mage can reflexively heal all bashing damage once per scene, no matter how much she has taken or whether or not she has any more severe wounds. In addition, she can spend one point of Mana to downgrade any lethal damage on her Health chart to bashing damage. Finally, if she suffers enough lethal damage to starting bleeding to death (see p. 173 of the World of Darkness Rulebo ok), she automatically spends a point of Mana and stabilizes herself. She is still unconscious, but is in no danger of dying unless she takes more damage. To use any of these powers, however, the character must either be in direct sunlight or be able to touch bare earth. The earth must be able to sustain plant life. Even a houseplant is enough, but if the character is in a city alleyway at night, she might have trouble using this Attainment. Optional Arcanum:Prime 3 A Rose of Eden who is also a Disciple of Prime can grow a true tree of life. The tree needs to be of a variety that bears fruit, and it must be grown without magical assistance (that is, the character must tend and water it normally). The mage must plant the tree herself, though a sapling works just as well as a seed. When the tree bears fruit, the fruits carry within them the power to heal. Anyone who eats the fruit of the tree is immediately healed of damage equal to the mage’s Gnosis, in either bashing or lethal damage. If the mage has Life 4, the fruits can heal aggravated damage as well. Although the mage cannot use Life magic to speed the growth of the tree, she can use any mundane method she wishes to speed up its growth. Abigail Mitchum was known to tend an apple tree using this Attainment, but she also grew tomato plants in her basement using hydroponics. The tomatoes worked just as well for healing as the apples. The mage must infuse the tree or plant with one point of Mana per day to allow the plant to soak up the necessary magic. Water infused with Tass is acceptable, and some Roses have even been known to infuse plant food tablets with Mana to feed their magical trees. If a plant goes more than three days without a point of Mana, it loses the ability to function as a Tree of Life until infused with a full month’s worth of Mana."

				"Description" : "“Awakening is the act of eating of the Tree of Knowledge,” Abigail Mitchum liked to say. “We listened to the Serpent, no matter what form he wore at the time, and we took a big bite. That’s not the Fall. The Fall was assuming that eating that fruit meant we knew something that other folks didn’t, and could neverknow.” Abigail felt, especially after her travels, that the Fall of Atlantis was relevant only insofar as it provided a good model of what not to do. Arrogance, elitism and pride were the enemies, and sectarianism and divisiveness were what strengthened those things. The Tree of Knowledge, she came to feel, was not dangerous because it revealed, but dangerous because knowledge itself was dangerous. Knowledge could paralyze or divide just as easily as it could teach or heal. And Abigail, never one for inaction, decided she would show people the unity that knowledge could provide. This Attainment was the result. Those mages who have experienced the Tree of Knowledge Attainment describe the feeling as extremely unsettling. The Attainment requires that all participants touch, skin to skin (holding hands is the usual method, though more intimate versions have been known to occur). The mage then uses the Attainment to make slight alterations in the Pattern of all of the participants, changing animal matter to plant matter on a cellular level. The result is an increased awareness of one another’s state of being and an ability to understand one another, which lasts for the duration of the scene. The participants all feel a sudden dulling of sensation from sound and sight, but experience a kind of synesthesia — they feel light rather than seeing it. Also, perception of difference between people fades, not to visual perception, but to cognitive association. That is, participants notice details like race, size, age and so on, but do not attach much meaning to them. In game terms, the player rolls Presence + Empathy + Life. Any character that wishes to resist can roll Resolve + Gnosis, contesting the mage’s roll. If the mage succeeds, all participants gain an immediate sense of t he p hy s ic a l he a lt h o f eve r yo ne invo lve d , s imila r t o t he Life spell “Healer’s Trance.” In addition, the characters become passive and incapable of violence against one another for the duration of the scene, though they are capable of defending themselves against outside threats (any combat rolls made by participants during this s c e ne s u f fe r a –1 mo d ifi e r, t ho u g h). F in a lly, p a r t icip a nt s become linked on a deep and primal level for a short time. Reactions to surprise are made collectively — as long as one player succeeds, none of the others are surprised. Also, the participants can disperse injury among them, potentially ignoring it altogether. Two participants can absorb a point of bashing damage, five can absorb a point of lethal damage, and eight can absorb a point of aggravated damage. Example: A Ro s e o f Ed e n u s e s Tr e e o f Kn o wl e d g e to l i n k a cabal of mages and their Sleepwalker servants — seven people in total (five mages, including the Noddist, and two Sleepwalkers). As they are growing accustomed to their new awareness, a trio of Seers of the Throne attacks the cabal. One Seer takes a baseball bat to one of the mages and inflicts three levels of bashing damage. Every two people linked by the Tree of Knowledge absorb one point of bashing damage, however, so none of the damage gets through (all seven of the participants wince a bit, but no injury occurs). Another Seer stabs a Sleepwalker for four points of lethal damage. Since it takes five participants to absorb a point of lethal damage, only one point is absorbed. The participants distribute the other three; three characters each suffer one point of lethal damage. Finally, the last Sleeper casts a destructive spell that inflicts two points of aggravated damage to the Noddist. Since only seven people are linked by the Tree, this damage cannot be absorbed, but it can be distributed so that the mage doesn’t have to suffer both (or any) damage. Optional Arcanum:Prime 4 If the mage also possesses Prime 4, two additional effects occur when she links a group with the Tree of K no wle d ge. F ir s t , t he p a r t icip a nt s a ll e njo y t he b e nefit s of “Supernal Vision” for the scene, even if they are Sleepers. Second, all participants become resistant to outside magic. Any spell that targets one member of the group suffers a modifier as though trying to target all of them. This modifier is applied whether or not the mage would actually be capable of affecting all of the participants. Example:Continuing with the above example, one of the Seers tries using the Death spell “Enervation” on the Rose of Eden. The Seer only has Death 4, and so is not capable of casting the spell at sensory range (and thus cannot affect all seven targets at once). Nevertheless, the roll suffers a –6 penalty as though the mage were trying to work in Target factors to affect the whole group (and this is in addition to any magical armor that the Noddist character might have!)."

				"Text" : "Every mage must reach across the Abyss to grasp Supernal power. This is no mere initiatic hurdle to weed out the unworthy, but a very real danger to a mage’s psyche, for the Abyss is far from empty. Awash in its torrents, its darkness clings, permeating clothing, body and soul. The slightest misstep in the Abyss can so derange the enlightened that any illumination they transmit is tainted with madness. Thus do the Legacies collectively known as the Scelesti —the Accursed —come into being. If the hordes of the Abyss can be said to have an agenda or motive, it would seem to be a desire to claim the Fallen World in lieu of the shining realms of the Supernal World that are closed to them. These entities, languishing in a kind of non-existence between the pure light of the Supernal and the gross matter of the Fallen World, seek to establish themselves in the latter. To accomplish this, an Abyssal entity must have some instrument through which to work its will in the material world. The Scelesti are such instruments. Unable to emerge in being by their own power alone, Abyssal beings must first make themselves known to an Awakened consciousness, who can then make their presence real in the Fallen World by writing the spirits’unpronounceable names across the earth in letters of fear, suffering and disaster. Mages who gaze too long into the Abyss fall prey to fascination and awe, their souls bound up in madness and obsession with the yawning chasms of unreason. Some might escape with psychic scars. Others fall prey to their own delusions and desires. Mistaking the vastness of the Abyss for a source of knowledge and strength, they abandon all sense and reason to lose themselves in endless chaos. Or they pledge themselves to the entities that lurk therein, and so consign their souls to oblivion. Those who are able to retain enough of their identity to contain their madness find that the Abyss has power in and of itself, apart from the hordes of non-beings that haunt it. Some swim in a primordial ocean of chaosplasm, riding its currents and shaping it to their ends. Others are lost to the void, their inner light swallowed in darkness and silence. Still others may find twisted reflections of their Supernal ideals in delusions. Meanwhile, the new overlords of the corrupted mages goad them on with promises of worldly glory and opulence —once the Fallen World has fallen into their clutches, of course. Such a thing cannot be accomplished alone, however, so the immediate task of the Scelesti becomes that of luring other mages into their sway and bringing them to the brink of the Abyss. Being one of the Accursed has its advantages. In a corrupt world, the expert corrupter can rule. The Abyssal hordes are not without power, and grant portions of their might to a mage who can provide them with a foothold in the Fallen World. And there are legions of lesser entities, any of which may be dispatched to serve a Scelestus as slave, guardian or familiar. Damnation by this magical course is not specific to any Path. Inheritors of this Legacy may be found practicing anywhere in mage society, using arcane symbolism and hermetic secrecy to conceal their true nature from peers and the rest of the world. Sometimes when a Scelestus is discovered within an order, his entire tutorial lineage may be stricken from the order’s records if it cannot be determined at which point a teacher was corrupted. (Hence, the Scelesti are also sometimes called Nefandi, the Unutterable, or “that which is not to be spoken of.”)"

The Abyss is not entirely without its own internal “politics,” however, with alliances and enmities forming between its most powerful entities.

He must first create a “magic circle,”and can affect spirits only while he is within the circle (although he can affect them with magic at a distance while he is standing in his circle). Creating the circle requires an instant action (no roll required), and its radius can equal the mage’s Space dots. [[MtAw_Legacy_Scelesti_MagicCircle]]If a mage has Space 2, he can use the advanced area affecting chart (see p. 118), using dots instead of dice penalties. Before the circle is complete, the mage must demarcate its outmost boundaries. The most common method is to scrape a piece of chalk or marker in a dash along each of the four cardinal directions, although the mage could just as easily place coins, empty coffee cups or soda cans, or even dirt if he doesn’t want to be too obvious about doing something arcane. Once established, the circle lasts for up to one hour. If two or more of the four markers are moved or erased, the effect is canceled until the circle is established again. While he stands within the circle, the mage gains an effect similar to the Spirit 1 “Spirit Tongue”spell (p. 246), allowing him to see and speak with nearby spirits. Optional Arcanum: Death 2 If the mage also has Death 2, he can affect ghosts in the same manner that he affects spirits."

An instant action is performed and Presence + Intimidation + Spirit is rolled, contested by a Resistance roll for the spirit. Each success allows the mage to issue a command of increasing complexity. He can repeatedly use this attainment while the circle is operative, but he can issue only one command to a spirit at a time. He cannot command the same spirit again until his first command is completed. Optional Arcanum: Time 3 If the mage also has Time 3, he can command a spirit to speak of the future. The spirit itself does not know the future, but becomes a mouthpiece by which the mage can ask questions of what is to come. This is similar to the Time 3 “Divination”spell (p. 263). The mage performs an instant action and can ask one question about a specified target’s future per Time dot. This power can be used concerning the same target only once every 24 hours."

The mage can do this as many times as he likes, stepping back and forth, as long as his magic circle is operative. He can leave the circle, but must return (or create a new circle) to step over again. Optional Arcanum: Time 4 If the mage also has Time 4, he can use a spirit as the mouthpiece of a greater prophecy, similar to the Time 4 “Prophecy”spell (p. 264).

				"Text" : "What makes humanity special? Is it the capacity to Awaken? Such a view is arrogant in the extreme, say the Sphinxes, for to look at the Sleepers as inferior is to ignore one’s own humanity. No, to the mages who choose to follow this Legacy, the true magic of humanity is language. More to the point, it is the capacity for symbolic recognition, to see a gesture or a marking, hear a collection of sounds, and from that understand. Human beings are optimized, either by the design of a greater being or the rigors of evolution, toward speech and language, both anatomically and neurologically. But all of the biophysical adaptations of the human body toward speech mean nothing without the ability to understand symbols. Upon this phenomenon (some would say “miracle”), the Legacy of the Sphinx is based. Walking the path of the Sphinx is an exercise in abstraction, for the Legacy teaches understanding without processing, learning truth without realizing fact. A Sphinx sees meaning everywhere — in the number of cracks in a sidewalk, in the seemingly random sounds from a baby’s babbling, in the texture of a brick wall. Intrinsic in this ability to find meaning anywhere is the knowledge that this meaning comes from somewhere. Sphinxes who cleave to the Atlantean model of mystical understanding posit that this meaning might come from ancient masters sending information forward in time, in a much more subtle way than with the ananke (see p. 330 of Mage: The Awakening). Those who do not follow the orders of the Pentacle — and even some who do — believe that this truth comes directly from the Supernal Realms. The name “Sphinx,” of course, comes from the mythological creature that Oedipus confronted near Thebes. He solved the riddle of the Sphinx, and she leaped to her death in horror that her secret was revealed. Whether the name “Sphinx” was one that members of this Legacy originally applied to themselves or not, they do not see themselves as jealous keepers of secrets. Indeed, they tend to view themselves as searchers trying to solve a riddle. That riddle is difficult to express, because it is so vast in scope, but the basic idea is this: If meaning can be found in anything, at any level of understanding or consciousness, then what is the ultimate meaning? Where does the truth come from, and to what purpose?"
			}, {
				"Title" : "Orders",
				"Text" : "While any Mastigos can become a Sphinx, the Legacy’s membership is primarily drawn from the Mysterium. The order’s predilection for finding, analyzing and cataloguing knowledge, combined with the fact that the Mysterium often encounters information too dangerous to be read and understood by an untrained mage, points members of all Paths toward the Legacy. Outside of the Mysterium, the order that claims the largest number of Pathfinders is unquestionably the Guardians of the Veil. Sphinxes are by nature superlative ciphers, capable of breaking almost any code or circumventing any puzzle, given enough time. The Guardians thus appreciate their ability to weave symbols and hidden messages, both true and misleading, into the secret societies and fronts that the order sets up. In fact, it isn’t uncommon for an Epopt to be a Sphinx herself or at least work with one. It’s easy for even the Guardians themselves to become lost in the morass of conflicting symbolism and double-blind codes, and a Sphinx makes a good “skeleton key” when quick understanding and interpretation are necessary. Warlocks of other orders do find their way to the Legacy as well, of course. Sphinxes of the Adamantine Arrow tend to use their ability to find meaning and truth in the mundane as a way to avoid danger and protect those around them. Pathfinders in the Free Council stay on the cutting edge of linguistic theory and language development, searching for ways to expand people’s understanding of each other and themselves. The Silver Ladder’s few Sphinxes often believe that the Ladder is the best way to recreate some of the conditions in lost Atlantis, and thus come closer to the secrets and messages that the ancients held."

The messages are all heavily coded and require time and effort to encode or decode, but the wealth of knowledge that a Sphinx of the order can draw upon is great. Outside the order, Pathfinders have little in the way of formal contact, though when they encounter each other the meeting is usually friendly. The relationship between mentor and student varies. Since the training requires so much intuition and comparatively little actual study, some students come to resent their mentors, feeling that they are deliberately keeping secrets and knowledge from the students. Others (typically those who go on to become successful as Sphinxes) recognize that the philosophy and wisdom of the Legacy is extremely difficult to teach, and respect their mentors all the more because of it."

				"Text" : "After the Fall of Atlantis and the subsequent scattering of mages across the world, language became a barrier rather than a tool for the Awakened. The greatest secrets of the Supernal Realms were fractured, shards of power and knowledge spread out among the mages of the world. Without the Island of the Magi’s society to compile the knowledge, the Awakened had to work alone or in small cabals, never knowing enough of the truth to recapture their past glories. The Sphinx Legacy arose from the frustration of those mages. The Mastigos of the time knew that with the application of the Mind Arcanum they could comprehend any earthly language, but that wasn’t enough. Language wasn’t the true barrier, these mages discovered, because a language is merely a set of symbols. These primordial Sphinxes realized that inherent in the process of making symbols lay the solution to the confusion caused by the destruction of the Celestial Ladder — that they could look beyond graphemes and sounds and simply communicate with pure meaning. Modern-day Sphinxes sometimes claim that the Legacy was an important part of the formation of the Mysterium, and that might well be true. Whether or not this was the case, the Sphinx Legacy became, over time, the province of the Wings of the Dragon almost exclusively. While a lone Mastigos might occasionally discover and follow the Legacy, the order guarded its secrets jealously. Something as basic to humanity as the quest for communication and language, however, wasn’t going to remain under lock and key forever."
			}, {
				"Title" : "The De Velasco Resurgence",
				"Text" : "The first reliably recorded instance of a mage outside the Mysterium joining the Legacy came in 1575 or so, in a book written by a Spanish nobleman (and Mastigos) named Juan de Velasco. De Velasco had observed his two young cousins, who were both born deaf, being tutored by a Benedictine monk named Pedro Ponce de Léon. Classical opinions on the deaf stated that they had very little education potential and that they could never learn to speak (if deafness occurred pre-lingually). Ponce de Léon, himself a Sleeper, challenged that opinion, and taught the de Velasco brothers not only to read and write, but to speak three different languages. He did not, however, record his methods, and so history would have to wait for widespread methods of educating the deaf, but Juan de Velasco watched his cousins’ lessons with interest. He was less interested in teaching deaf people than in the conveyance of meaning in non-verbal ways. He wrote several treatises on the topic for his Consilium, the most famous of which was titled “The Art and Science of the Recognition of Meaning.” In that document, he detailed how he was able to send coded messages through paintings and divine the immediate future by listening to hymns at Mass (as later mages have pointed out, de Velasco probably wasn’t reading the future per se; rather, he was reading probability). De Velasco’s writings have been translated into many different languages over the years, although modern Sphinxes have found that reading them in their original Latin yields layers of meaning far beyond the simple message of the words. The Mysterium currently holds most of these documents, but de Velasco was a prolific writer and painter, and historians the world over might unknowingly hold either one of his esoteric writings or hauntingly beautiful paintings. Either type of work might actually be a road map to a rote, an Atlantean temple or some other worthy goal. De Velasco left no record behind of a pupil, but it is widely accepted that de Velasco passed his learning along to another Mastigos. Whether this pupil was a member of the Mysterium or not is a debated issue; the order claims that he was, while members of all of the other orders also claim him (and often have records that seem to support their claims). The Mysterium has history on its side, of course, but after de Velasco the Legacy became available to any mage of the order who wished to become a Pathfinder. Since then, the Mysterium has tried to project the image that they created the Legacy in the first place. Even so, the Legacy remains the province of the Warlocks just as much as that of the Alae Draconis. Other than de Velasco, history has not produced famous Sphinxes. The Pathfinders tend to be inscrutable and unobtrusive, even by Awakened standards, and, of course, any mage who achieved mastery of the Legacy’s Attainments would be exceptionally difficult to find in any record (see the Off the Path Attainment, below). The Mysterium, true to form, tries to keep records of the members of the order who have gone on to become Pathfinders, but the Sphinxes themselves often alter such records, leaving behind only obtuse riddles that, properly interpreted, might lead to the mage in question."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Society and Culture",
				"Text" : "Because so much of the Sphinx mindset and activity relies on observation rather than direct action, mages outside of the Mysterium don’t often know much about the Legacy. What they do know tends to depend on who they hear it from or the particular Sphinx they’ve encountered. Some Sphinxes are infuriatingly cryptic, either because they genuinely enjoy lording their uncanny insight over others or because they are inundated with so much information that they fear to reveal too much or too little. Other Sphinxes are happy to share what they know, but are well aware that their information tends to be true, but lacking in context. Consider: A Sphinx can read a thick book in an ancient language in an hour and understand all of the information it contains, but he will be hard-pressed to convey the nuances and intricacies of the information. His rendition of the information resembles a quick summary, and this leaves listeners to wonder about its accuracy. Indeed, it’s not uncommon for non-Sphinxes to assume that a Pathfinder is using some kind of fortune-telling method to glean the information, and such methods (often based on Time or Space magic) aren’t often completely accurate. The Sphinxes protest this, saying that their methods rely on direct observation rather than symbolic guesswork, but because those methods are based largely on intuition that non-Sphinxes do not possess these protests often go unheard. In the end, many Pathfinders find it easiest not to advertise their membership in the Legacy and to offer help and advice only when it is requested. Of course, that sometimes results in other mages labeling them reclusive and unhelpful, but an experienced Pathfinder has long since given up on pleasing all the people all the time. The culture of the Sphinx Legacy is one of research, academia and intuition. Sphinxes aren’t necessarily impulsive, but they do tend to be easily distracted, and mentors of the Legacy encourage Pathfinders to follow clues that they see in the hidden patterns of the world. This leads Sphinxes to cross paths with cabals of mages and even stranger inhabitants of the World of Darkness, and so members of the Legacy tend to be skilled at either diplomacy or flight (or, more rarely, defensive combat). Among the Awakened, Sphinxes try to become well-versed in which cabal holds influence in what area and who the local movers and shakers of the Consilium are, just in case the Sphinxes need to name-drop to justify trespassing. Their skill in dealing with people grants them a great deal of latitude in such situations, and so Sphinxes often occupy positions in a Consilium such as Herald or Councilor. In the Mysterium, the Sphinx takes up the role of guardian, much like his namesake. Sphinxes don’t ask riddles of seekers, but they also don’t give information out to just anyone. This isn’t due to a perception that others aren’t worthy of the knowledge (usually), but rather that the knowledge in question might be dangerous. Sphinxes can absorb information without attracting its attention, learning by observation of patterns rather than direct reading and study. As such, a Sphinx might administer a coded test to a mage seeking a book or fact that the Sphinx considers risky. If the mage has the patience and skill to decipher it, the Sphinx considers it safe to grant the mage what he seeks. This role, of course, is the very definition of a thankless task, since it brands the Sphinx as a stingy distributor of knowledge. Even so, it is a role for which the Pathfinders are uniquely suited, and so members of the Legacy who belong to the Mysterium often become Censors. The Legacy’s overarching philosophy — that the universe has meaning and that this meaning was put in place deliberately — doesn’t actually see much discussion among Sphinxes unless one of them has made a breakthrough. New members of the Legacy often hear the theory on the matter that their tutors espouse, and pick up more as they interact with other Pathfinders. Most Sphinxes have preconceived notions about the nature of the meaning of the universe. Popular hypotheses include the following: • God: Regardless what religion or faith the Sphinx espouses, the notion of a Divine creator (or at least organizer) is almost as popular among mages as among Sleepers. The fact that no explanation of Atlantis, the Fall, the Celestial Ladder or the Supernal Realms actually contradicts this belief is helpful. Theist Sphinxes believe that the messages they see in everyday patterns are God’s communication with Earth, and that the language of pure meaning is the true divine language. • Oracles: Sphinxes with a more magic-centered view of the world believe that the Oracles, the secret masters trapped in the Supernal Realms during the collapse of the Celestial Ladder, manipulate events and patterns so subtly that these machinations are virtually unnoticeable unless one is specifically looking. These Sphinxes claim that, with rare exceptions (such as the ananke), the Oracles cannot communicate directly, as the Abyss thwarts them. Only by nudging the world in imperceptible ways — causing a flock of birds to take flight at the right second, a gust of wind that alters the direction of raindrops, and so on — can they send their messages. Of course, if the Oracles can do this, the Sphinxes sometimes wonder, what stops the Exarchs from doing so as well? The answer is: nothing, and the Seers of the Throne boast their share of Pathfinders. • The Supernal Realms: Although the Sphinx Legacy belongs as much to the Warlocks as to the Mysterium, comparatively few Mastigos espouse this particular theory to explain the origin of the messages in the world. Those who do are quite different from the usual contemplative and observant Pathfinders — such Mastigos tend to be fearful and paranoid. Some Sphinxes believe that the denizens of the Supernal Realms are responsible for the informative patterns that the Sphinxes so diligently analyze. These denizens might not even be creating these patterns deliberately, the mages say, but the Fallen World reflects the Supernal Realms. Therefore, the true nature of reality comes through in everything the world has to offer, regardless of whether Sleepers (or even most of the Awakened) are prepared to look for it. Of course, the implications of the inhabitants of Pandemonium leaving hints for mages to find are troubling, to say the least. This, perhaps, is why this theory has more adherents among Mysterium Sphinxes of other Paths. The notion that the patterns are the inhuman whispers of demons is profoundly disquieting. No matter which Supernal Realm the patterns originate from, though (and it would make more sense to assume that allof them have some input), their natives are inscrutable and largely unknowable by human standards, yet certainly not all-powerful. Is there a greater design above even the mysterious clues left in random patterns of wind, ink and brick?"
			}, {
				"Title" : "Induction",
				"Text" : "Prospective Sphinxes often begin their training for the Legacy before they know it exists. Inquisitive and persistent, they pay close attention to the world around them, searching for an overlying meaning. Chaos theory, fractal theory and even the “theory” of intelligent design have produced students of the right mindset to become Pathfinders. If a mage looks deeply enough into the right patterns, using the right methods, he might receive a flash of insight that allows him to break a message coded with the Hidden Meaning Attainment. Alternately, his studies might just lead him to a mage already known for the same kind of research. In any case, sooner or later the prospective Sphinx finds a Sphinx. Presuming that the Sphinx that the prospective member finds is willing and able to take on a pupil, and that the chemistry between the two mages is of the right sort to permit such a relationship, the tutor typically inundates the student with coded messages. At first, the mage simply uses mundane codes, starting with simple alphabetical ciphers and moving up to complex encryption. The mage doesn’t need to learn how to break all of these codes, and certainly isn’t forbidden from using magic in his attempt. The important lesson here is to look beyond letters, numbers and words and see meaning in markings, sounds and patterns. This kind of approach isn’t easy to teach, as it relies more on intuition than process, and some mages simply aren’t up to the task. The tutor watches carefully to see if his student is capable of learning what the tutor is presenting, of seeing a meaning greater than the message. If so, they can begin the process of soulcrafting. If not, the tutor gently (or not-so-gently, depending on the mage in question) suggests that the student might find what he seeks elsewhere. In the Mysterium, the process works a little differently. Mages who show a predilection for puzzles, ciphers and language are often told about the Legacy in a roundabout fashion (so as to avoid making it seem as though membership in a Legacy is being offered or suggested). A mage who is a good candidate for becoming a Pathfinder will pursue information about the Legacy, or so goes the theory. Once word gets out in a given Consilium’s Mysterium cabal(s) that a mage wants to join the Legacy, the network becomes activated and the mage’s accomplishments, history, faults and foibles are made known to any Sphinx who bothers to check. If the mage is a good fit for the Legacy, a tutor arranges to travel to the student or have the student brought to him for training. In either case, the stages of soulcrafting don’t require much in the way of ceremony. Once a mage has reached the required level of power, his tutor assists him in delving deeper into the mysteries of the world’s wisdom. This is normally accompanied by several days of study, questioning and observation of whatever phenomena the mentor feels hold the wisdom the student needs in order to progress. Some tutors hole their students up in libraries preceding a new Attainment, others immerse their charges in as much sensation as possible in order to force the student to focus on one pattern at a time. Tutors, whatever their methods, watch their students for signs of madness at all times. When everything around a mage is significant, when nothingis coincidence or meaningless, he can feel paralyzed and helpless, afraid to do anything for fear of offsetting some cosmic balance. Alternately, some Sphinxes become drunk with the power and knowledge they possess, striving to learn as much as they can to exert maximum possible influence in the world. Either of these eventualities is cause for alarm to the tutor, because they distract the student from his quest to learn the origin of meaning. A Sphinx who degenerates too much or too quickly in Wisdom might find himself placed in an oubliette, magically deprived of any sensation whatsoever. It is believed that, in this kind of environment with no patterns from which to derive information, that a mad Sphinx can find himself again and regain his sanity. This doesn’t always work, of course; sometimes the madness just intensifies, but the oubliette is the best the Legacy can do to help. The alternative is to remove the mage’s ability to see the world’s meaning permanently, and the only way to do that is to kill him."

				"Description" : "The Sphinx’s first Attainment allows her to find and decipher wisdom in the mundane. Anything that has a pattern can be used for this purpose, be it cracks in the ceiling or the calls of a flock of birds. The mage merely needs to study the pattern for a few seconds to gain the information contained therein. The effect is similar to the Fate 1 “Interconnections” spell (see p. 148 of Mage: The Awakening), except that the Attainment requires only an instant action and bestows information as though the mage had achieved five successes on the roll. Sphinxes, therefore, are awash in information if they stop to consider it, able to see connections, however faint, between any objects, people or places in sight. In addition to see these sympathetic connections, a Sphinx can use this Attainment to solve puzzles and riddles, since she can see the patterns behind their creation. Sphinx characters with this Attainment receive a +3 modifier to all Mental rolls involving riddles, puzzles, mazes or other such conundrums. A more common use of this Attainment, however, is its ability to hide meaning within seemingly random patterns. A Sphinx can use Hidden Meaning to write (or draw or record) a message in a code that no Sleeper cipher can crack. The mage must physically create the message, either by writing a seemingly innocuous letter, drawing a picture or any other method she prefers. The player rolls Manipulation + Investigation or Academics to encrypt the message. When another mage with this Attainment tries to decipher the code, her player must make an extended Intelligence + Investigation roll to do so, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x the successes on the encryption roll]. Again, each roll requires an hour of deciphering. The encoding mage may choose to forego her roll, meaning that any Sphinx can decode the message automatically. A mage with Fate 2 can also attempt to uncover the meaning in the message. First she must be aware that the underlying meaning exists, which is by itself difficult (she might be tipped off by an ally, a hunch or even the Dream Merit). She then casts an improvised and extended Fate 2 spell, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x encoder’s successes, minimum of five]. Optional Arcanum: Mind 2 A Sphinx who has studied the Arcanum of Mind can use her knowledge of the patterns and intrinsic meaning to aid her in interactions with others. By studying a person’s movements, the subtle messages conveyed by facial expression, body language and breathing and even how others react to him, the Sphinx gains an advantage in dealing with him. This effect is similar to the Mind 2 “First Impressions” spell (see p. 208 of Mage: The Awakening). The Sphinx may add her dots in Mind as a dice bonus to the first roll made with a given target. Many Pathfinders discover that the first Attainment of the Legacy is all that they require. Indeed, much of the Legacy’s reputation is based upon the knowledge and insight conveyed in Hidden Meaning — the ability to solve puzzles and escape labyrinths, to see meaning in the mundane. Sphinxes who continue on use this Attainment as a basis upon which later, more powerful magic rests. Those who pursue other agendas, however, use Hidden Meaning to send messages to double agents in other factions (or even orders), to share research with colleagues around the world, right under the noses of their enemies, and to help Sleepers and even other mages solve puzzles that no methods the Fallen World has produced can fathom. Sphinxes who make frequent use of this Attainment to encrypt messages often develop a preferred format for those messages. One Sphinx might design websites dedicated to some inane fandom, while another writes poetry reproduced only in small-circulation periodicals. As long as the message reaches its intended viewer, the Sphinx doesn’t often care how the vehicle for the message is regarded. Sometimes, though, a Sphinx creates a vehicle for a message that has resonance and value in its own right. When this happens, the message might gain fame and widespread circulation, inadvertently passing the message along to any mage who knows how to look for it. Some such messages are even rumored to trigger Awakenings, as Sleepers on the verge of enlightenment see the Supernal Realms lurking in an otherwise mundane painting or song."

				"Description" : "Knowing the truth of the world by interpreting its many hidden messages is only the first step toward the superlative understanding that the Sphinx hopes one day to reach. Along that way, however, she learns to take advantage of the clues that surround her as to the fundamental nature of reality. To the untrained eye, she looks lucky or simply confident, but to a mage, every action she takes is fraught with significance. The second Attainment that a Sphinx can achieve allows her to mimic the effects of the Fate 2 “Exceptional Luck” spell (see p. 151 of Mage: The Awakening). No roll or Mana expenditure is required. The mage simply takes an instant action to study the patterns of meaning around her, in the same way as described for the Hidden Meaning Attainment. The player may then designate a number of rolls equal to the character’s Gnosis rating during the same scene to have the 9 again quality. Pathfinders also find that the more they rely on this Attainment, the more resonant their actions become. Mage Sight cast through the Fate Arcanum can easily detect them. Mages attempting to use Fate spells such as “Interconnections” or “The Sybil’s Sight” receive a +1 dice bonus during any scene in which Sphinx has used this Attainment to gain the 9 again quality. This bonus can cancel penalties levied by the Occultation Merit and spells such as Fate 3 “Fabricate Fortune.” Optional Arcanum: Mind 3 By listening to patterns of sound in speech (or watching patterns of letters in written discourse), the mage can understand anything she hears or reads. This mimics the Mind 3 “Universal Language” spell, save that the mage can only understand rather than express with this Attainment. Also, she can perform research and learning-related extended Mental tasks in half the time they would normally take (that is, if every roll in an extended task would normally take an hour, this time is reduced to 30 minutes). The second Attainment of the Sphinx Legacy opens the mage further to the truth of the world and the hidden messages it contains, but still does not address the question of who or what might be sending these messages. Pathfinders at this stage make superb interpreters, translators and researchers (which is one reason the Mysterium teaches this Legacy). More martial Sphinxes enjoy the tactical benefits of this Attainment, but are careful when using it in conflict with other Awakened, as the Sphinxes are wary of coming to the notice of powerful mages by weaving themselves too tightly into the universe’s inner workings. Indeed, the Sphinxes tell stories of members of the Legacy who have become unable to see the world as anything other than an abstract mess of implication and possibility — unable to perceive light or sound anymore, they function solely through the information this Attainment grants."

				"Description" : "The mage learns to “walk between” the paths of meaning in the world, disappearing from the cycles of destiny. As far as the world and its many layers of hidden messages are concerned, the Sphinx no longer exists (for as long as this Attainment is active). The Sphinx spends a moment in silent meditation, perceiving the threads of fate and stepping between them (this requires three turns of contemplation). After this, the mage’s destiny can remain “invisible” in this manner for as long as she wishes, but during this time she cannot use the Truth Without Knowledge Attainment to gain the 9 again quality, or cast any spell altering another person’s destiny (this include spells dealing with oaths, such as “Alter Oath,” as well as spells such as “Occlude Destiny” or “Destroy Bindings”). While the Attainment is active, however, she is immune to all spells that would perceive, alter, improve or denigrate her fate (including the spells just mentioned). All sympathetic magic targeted against her is considered to be four steps further removed. (So, to even attempt targeting her with a sympathetic spell, the caster would need an Intimate connection, which would then suffer a –10 penalty as though it were Described.) Also, the Sphinx is extremely difficult to scrutinize magically. She is considered to have the Occultation Merit at a rating equal to her dots in the Fate Arcanum. This Attainment does not make the character physically invisible, but does make her easy to ignore. She receives a +3 on all Stealth rolls while the Attainment is active. Optional Arcanum: Mind 4 Reading a person’s intentions isn’t difficult; a Sphinx can decipher a target’s basic mood and reactions enough to play off them with the first Attainment of the Legacy. At this advanced stage, however, a tic of the eye or a shift of the hand betrays everything about the target — his hopes, his fears and even his memories. This effect is much like the Mind 4 “Read the Depths” spell (see p. 215 of Mage: The Awakening). The mage must spend at least one turn studying the target before using this Attainment. After that, the player rolls Intelligence + Academics – the subject’s Composure. Unlike Read the Depths, mages with the Mind Arcanum do notget a chance to detect the Attainment’s effect, since it is based entirely on external observation rather than telepathic intrusion. Modifiers for distant memories might apply, but memories or experiences that significantly contributed to the target’s development (such as child abuse or the death of an important figure) might actually grant bonuses, even if the target has repressed them. The third Attainment of the Legacy allows the Sphinx to exert some influence over the world’s meanings. Very few Sphinxes progress to this point, because most of them focus more on discovering what being or phenomenon is responsible for the meaning of the world. Those who do are among the most powerful and inscrutable beings in the World of Darkness, fully in tune with the world’s patterns and able to step outside of those patterns at any time."

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "Among the most enigmatic of Legacies is the Subtle Ones, mages who “do without doing,”who are “inthe world but not ofit.”Look for them and they are gone. Many doubt their very existence, but those who understand their ways can detect their influence throughout the world. Their names are not recorded by history, but much of history was written by them. Their faces may not be found upon monumental statuary, but most monuments are carved according to proportions devised by a Subtle hand. Though they heed no bounds and move by routes unknown, it is their pen that dictates where roads and borders are laid. To some they are skulking villains who dare not show their faces. To others they are the secret chiefs of the great conspiracy that brings the world to order. To themselves, they are simply the Subtle Ones, or the Ahl-i-Batin, the “People of the Inner Truth”who serve as the culture-bearers of civilization —not by bringing the world to order, but by bringing order to the world. Batini magic utilizes sacred geometry to open the mind to divine reality. By studying the complexities of spatial relationships and proportionality, the soul can compose itself to harmonize with the world, and so compose the world. Subtle lore traces itself back to the architects and city planners of Atlantis, for whom sociology was no mere science but a magical art. They believed that a harmonious society that both sustains and fulfills all its members could be achieved through proper patterning of the space it occupies, engendering proper patterns of behavior in occupants. This social engineering concerned itself with everything from broad geographical plans to the minutiae of detail in art, music and literature. Every aspect of culture could be made to reflect —and so teach and encourage —greater social harmony. The Subtle Ones exerted substantial influence in all the great civilizations of the world up through the European Renaissance until their power, obtained largely through the work of agents placed within major political and religious institutions, waned as secular society waxed. At present, the Subtle Ones are too few and scattered to enact any of their plans on a large scale, but have learned to keep themselves insinuated into the ever-changing administrations of modern politics, mostly by seizing posts within the intelligence community. They also maintain a constant presence in the worlds of art, fashion, communication and education. From these positions they can control (or at least influence to some nominal degree) the excesses and vicissitudes of society at large. Because the Subtle Ones are so arcane and secretive about themselves, their motives are often called into question by other mages. Their hand has been discerned in innumerable plots and intrigues throughout history, most notably in the Order of Assassins, a deviant sect of Ishmaelite Islam. From its network of impregnable mountaintop fortresses, this group dispatched highly trained operatives to extend its influence, from fanatically suicidal hit men to skilled and patient deep-cover agents. Some consider this sect to be the Subtle Ones’crowning achievement, a spiritually inclined utopian society sustaining itself in the midst of a hostile social climate with a minimum of military force. Others see the Assassins as the very worst of the Subtle Ones’work —secluded and insular, using murder as a tool to separate themselves from the outside world for an autocratic leader who claims overweening spiritual authority while commanding his mind-slaves to kill themselves as a demonstration of his power. The final words of the sect’s founder, the legendary Old Man of the Mountain, Hassan-i-Sabbah — “Nothing is true, everything is permitted!” —is often taken to indicate the deeply amoral identity of this Legacy. In fact, the Subtle Ones do not hesitate to engage in acts that would be condemned by most spiritual traditions. The Ahl-i-Batinalso employ a number of ascetic practices taken to potentially dangerous extremes, including fasting, flagellation and self-mutilation. Their long history of brainwashing, mind control and social manipulation is cause for concern as well. Among their other disciplines, they cultivate the way of the unseen assassin, and are not above using violence or a convincing threat of violence to achieve their aims. Thus, they can be said to wield considerable temporal power. The Subtle Ones do not consider themselves to be the masters of the world, but merely the goad-servants of human evolution, scourging mankind to drive it up the spiritual slope toward an eventual postulated universal Awakening. As to when this will occur, the Legacy presents no clear answer. At present, the prevailing view is that too many secrets have been discovered (or leaked) to the Sleepers too soon, granting humanity a capacity for destruction in disproportionate excess to its current degree of moral development. This course presents a danger to the world as a whole, mages included, and so must be curbed by whatever means necessary."

				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "The Subtle Ones have made a science of anonymity and tend to blend into their surroundings, taking on local dress and customs with great facility, able to disappear instantly into a crowd or traffic. Inheritors of this Legacy are noted —if identified at all —for their quiet and reserved demeanor, as well as for their piercing gaze."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Background",
				"Text" : "The historical influence of the Subtle Ones was most strongly expressed among various esoteric traditions of the Middle East —gnosticism, qabalism, Sufism — and so many of its most enlightened members come from those traditions. Most of the terminology found in this Legacy is of Arabic or Persian derivation. The operations of the Subtle Ones are global in scope and their methodology is highly eclectic, so that Subtle Ones can be found almost anywhere. (Actually, it might be more correct to say that Subtle Ones are in place almost anywhere in the world. Whether they can actually be found is another matter.)"
			}, {
				"Title" : "Organization",
				"Text" : "Once his apprenticeship has concluded, the Subtle One seldom makes direct contact with other inheritors of his Legacy. Groups do sometimes form for a particular purpose, though; these are tightly knit and highly insular cells so extravagantly surreptitious that each member may not even know the identities of the others. Meetings are conducted with faces veiled and bodies cloaked. Speech never rises above a whisper, and separate routes are taken for entrances and exits. One might ask, with such a pall of secrecy, how the Ahl-i-Batinare able to maintain communications, much less a global conspiracy. The “master plan”of the Atlantean social engineers is reiterated throughout Batinilore, such that no inheritor is left without a thorough understanding of the role he is to play in the process of human evolution. This is not to imply that a Subtle One is merely a cog in a great machine, following a preprogrammed pattern. On the contrary, creativity and originality are prized and encouraged both within the Legacy and in the world at large. The local details of the collective plan vary from region to region, even from neighborhood to neighborhood in large cities, so facets must be communicated to newcomers. A Subtle One is trained to read broad cultural patterns — power structures, economic concerns, religious beliefs, artistic trends and personal tendencies —into styles of dress, art, building and music. Simply by glancing at any street corner or marketplace, he can divine any number of particulars about his surroundings. For example, the seemingly innocuous advertisements for shaving cream on local billboards might clue him in about a new religious fundamentalism that’s taking hold in the community, even though it’s not yet evident in anyone’s behavior. While the connection between shaving cream and fundamentalism would never occur to a casual observer, the subtle strands of unconscious belief and desire represented by the two forces are obvious to the Subtle One observer, allowing him to make intuitive leaps of understanding that are irrational or mystifying to others. Furthermore, Batiniare likely to have encoded their own innovations into the social fabric. Visitors might read specific messages and even elaborate reports in such ubiquitous details as an architectural ornament, a hemline border stitch, the layout of streets or the melody of a popular folk tune."

These clues hint at opportunities and openings for effecting major changes in society through minor deeds. This attainment is similar to a combination of the Mind 2 “Incognito Presence”spell (p. 208, allowing her to walk openly but unnoticed by others) and the Fate 1 “The Sybil’s Sight”spell (p. 149, allowing her to detect momentous events).

He performs an instant action (no roll required) and affects a number of senses (sight, sound, smell, touch and even taste) equal to his Mind dots. The effect lasts for up to an hour. In addition, he can alter the appearance of his own aura, changing its mental or emotional state (similar to the Mind 2 “Alter Aura”spell, p. 207), or even its nature (similar to the Prime 2 “Transform Aura”spell, p. 223. Use the mage’s Mind dots for Potency when comparing this effect against anyone trying to see past it. Optional Arcanum:Space 3 If she also knows Space 3, the mage can create sympathetic connections between people, places and things she observes during the Subtle Dance (above), similar to the Space 3 “New Threads”spell (p. 237). She performs an instant action and improves the degree of sympathy by one degree per dot of Space, although she cannot make a Sensory connection if the targets are not in sensory contact (direct sight, hearing or touch). An Intimate connection is the best possible in that situation. (The Storyteller determines the base degree of connection.) These threads are of lasting Duration, unless the natural course of events alters them (such as if two people’s relations become strained, decreasing their connection)."

Many examples of such ancient controls exist: Stonehenge, Mayan temples and even some Roman roads exist along ley lines or sit atop powerful nodes. By focusing the energy that courses over the Earth, the ancients were able to influence natural and unnatural occurrences wherever the energy flowed. They could cause crops to produce untold harvests, or create blight that led to starvation and death. They could inspire wisdom and understanding or fuel depravity and breed despair. And, through careful control of resonance, the Tellurians could aid in the creation of a nation or bring one to its knees. Wherever people have sought to control the power these lines possess, the Tellurians have always been nearby. Ever since the fall of Atlantis, these mages have dedicated their lives to understanding the power that flows from node to node. They have amassed vast libraries of maps detailing ley lines all over the world. However, as the world evolves and changes, so does the energy that flows around it. The work of the Tellurians is never done because the lines are constantly shifting. The original Tellurians were a disparate lot. Each discovered the power of the ley lines within their own cultures and learned to manipulate them as they advanced along their chosen Paths. Eventually they stumbled across other members of other Paths and orders who shared their interests, and the first Telluric Council was formed. They agreed that the ley lines should be observed and manipulated only for the prosperity of mankind. To enforce their will, they created the Telluric Wardens, a militant division that punishes those offenders who dare to destroy or manipulate ley lines for destructive purposes. The Obrimos were the original founders of the Tellurians because of their leanings towards the Prime Arcanum and interest in the flow of magic. Eventually, the Mysterium became interested in these trackers of ley lines, and other Paths were introduced to the Legacy. Each Path was able to turn their particular talent to understanding the resonances that supply the main power to the ley lines. The Acanthus devote themselves primarily to understanding how the particular resonances of ley lines and nodes affect the fates of those they touch. Mastigos are often the most adept with their knowledge of the Space Arcanum, and provide some of the best cartographers the Legacy possesses. The Moros of the Legacy are few and far between, although those who have joined focus most of their attention on how the different resonances affect Matter and inanimate objects. As the Legacy’s founders, Obrimos are by far the most common Path represented. The Thyrsus are a close second within the Legacy, as they are intimately concerned with the effects ley lines have on the physical and spiritual landscapes of the world."

The Mysterium is where most of the Legacy’s students are recruited from as they seek mentors in the Order’s libraries to extract information on the peculiar science of ley lines. The Wardens tend to come from the Adamantine Arrow. They are often found watching over nodes or acting as bodyguards to their researching colleagues. They are also the enforcers of the Telluric Council’s will, protecting fragile lines or punishing mages who disturb or destroy lines wantonly. The Guardians of the Veil, Free Council and Silver Ladder are in the minority of the orders represented among the Mapmakers.

Some followed the traditions of the Druids, manipulating all sorts of connections from toadstool circles to Stonehenge. Others learned the arts of feng shuiand manipulate the dragon lines on smaller levels in residential areas. However, they all followed their passion even after their Awakening, and sought greater understanding of ley lines through their magic. Most Mapmakers keep fastidious notes and maps so that they can keep track of the ley lines in their area and the different resonances that travel down them. Often they hold positions of power in the mortal world, which allow them to manipulate the architecture in the city they reside in or own swathes of untouched virgin forests to preserve the lines flowing within them."

Once in a blue moon, a younger member will perform a truly remarkable feat that earns them the respect and recognition of the Council, but most of the Mapmakers operate under the simple rule of “avoid the Council’s attention.” The strongest connection within the Legacy is between mentor and student. Someone interested in joining the Legacy has to first locate a Mapmaker who is willing to take him on as a student. He is then introduced to the Attainments and the vast libraries that the Mapmakers have accumulated over the centuries in the study of ley lines. Once the mentor believes the student is ready, the student faces a test to become a full-fledged member of the Legacy. This trial usually comes after the student learns the second Attainment. The tests range from successfully documenting the resonances of a particularly complex ley line to the mapping of all lines that intersect with a particular node. Once they successfully pass the test, they are free to do as they please. There is, however, retribution if a Mapmaker steps over the line. The Council’s interpretation of a wrongdoing does not follow most societal norms; they are far more concerned with the disruption of energy flow along the lines, and anything that destroys or significantly interferes with a large amount of ley lines will draw the Council’s immediate attention. Wardens are then dispatched to deal with the offending party."

The Skill of Science (Cartography) is also required as the Mapmaker keeps detailed maps of all the ley lines they find using the first Attainment. In addition to these Attainments, Mapmakers also generally know the spells “Ley Shift” (Sanctum and Sigil,p. 97), “Ley Flow” (Sanctum and Sigil,p. 98) and “Ley Lines” (Mage: The Awakening, p. 226), and possess the Geomancer Merit (see the sidebar on p. 7).",

Through mastery of Space and knowledge of the components of ley lines, the Mapmaker can enter any ley line at any point and travel to any node. Many Mapmakers explain it as opening a Portal (as per the spell in Mage: The Awakening, p. 238) and simply using the ley lines as a conduit. While they can enter a ley line at any point, they can only exit at a node, where the power lines cross and the energy is briefly disrupted. Many younger Mapmakers describe it as akin hopping a train or riding the subway. The Mapmaker can only take herself on the Ride, along with any non-living things she can hold onto. While the mage is Riding Between, they exist with the ley line and travel along its energy. They cannot be harmed until they step out at a node. Riding Between isn’t without its risks: unless the Mapmaker knows exactly where he is going, he could very well end up on top of a mountain in Tibet, in the middle of a battlefield in Africa or over the ocean in the middle of a hurricane."

				"Text" : "The syntax of the spoken language of Atlantis isn’t fully understood by any mage alive today. Small nuances in how a word is spoken, or used, can create major differences in meaning that would be almost impossible to comprehend just by studying the writings of a dead language. This is especially true in a tonal language (such as Chinese) in which the same word can have multiple meanings depending on how the syllable is stressed. It is no wonder, then, that some Atlantean words are difficult to translate properly into modern languages built on comparatively limited concepts. There are some who claim that Timori is one such word that has likely received an incomplete translation. Timori can certainly be translated as fearful. The word probably was used in association with the Locust-Eaters, who forsook magic to take their place in what they perceived as the natural order of the world. But those who tread this path state that another possible translation for Timori, one that has been overlooked or suppressed by modern scholars, is “feared.”"
			}, {
				"Title" : "History",
				"Text" : "According to the Legacy’s lore, their forebears weren’t content to simply take their leave of Atlantis and hope that the natural order sorted itself out. These mages had much more in common with their contemporary Banisher fellows than the more peaceful types who simply abandoned Atlantis. Those who refused to abandon Atlantis fought against the intrusion of magic into the world. They attacked magical constructs , destroyed repositories of magical knowledge and killed any mage they thought they could safely target. Although they disliked the use of magic, the Atlantean Banishers reluctantly concluded that it was necessary to use fire to fight fire. Citizens of Atlantis began to whisper about the traitors in their midst, calling them Timori, the feared, and the Banishers took up the name with pride. Eventually, the Timori cabals were uncovered by the Ungula Draconis and were either killed or forced into exile. Various records of the Atlantean era speak of the armies of Atlantis marching against the poorly developed tribes and city-states of the time. These attacks are usually explained by Awakened scholars as a symptom of the hubris that lead to Atlantis’s fall, but there are hints in the writings that suggest other possibilities. Here and there in the tales of the Atlantean armies’ exploits , a determined researcher can see a pattern. Phrases that are routinely translated as “And the fearful lived among the lesser people of the tribe and taught them to fear and hate us” take on a different meaning when fearful is translated as feared. It certainly seems likely that exiled Timori raised Sleeper armies to attack Atlantean shipping and outposts . When viewed in this light , not every action taken by Atlantis against the primitive societies seems like such an overt act of hubris. Years passed, and the Timori continued their harassment of Atlantean as sets . Ungula Dracon is teams sent out to deal with the Timori met with limited success, never managing to completely stamp them out. The Timori had resigned themselves to the idea that their battle might take centuries, when the first Mage War occurred. After celebrating their victory, the remaining mages of Atlantis raised their Ladder to the Heavens, and the worst nightmares of the Timori seemed to have come true. The Timori sought meetings with the newly exiled mages, to convince them anew of the Timori’s position. Reluctant at first to even speak to the Timori, let alone meet with them, the Exiles finally agreed to a temporary alliance when reality began to crack. Using the Sleeper armies of the Timori to assist, the Exiles took their fight back to Atlantis. While the Exiles fought their way up the Ladder into the Supernal, the Timori began to attempt to unravel the spells holding the Ladder together. Then came the explosion that sundered the world. The majority of the Timori at ground zero of the explosion were killed instantly by the collapse of the Ladder. Those who survived wept in despair. Despite their best efforts, the natural order of the world was destroyed, seemingly for good. The Timori went to the leaders of the surviving exiled mages and begged them to give up magic. “Look,” the Timori said, “at what our power has wrought. This is the awful cost of magic!” The Exiles, not seeing how they could possibly survive without their magic , refused the Timori’s entreaties and drove the Timori from them; the short alliance forever ended. With the Awakened community scattered and the members of the Timori reduced to a mere handful, the Timori decided on a new course of action. It would be impossible for t hem to watch each new mage settlement, let alone stage successful attacks, at their current numbers. New Banishers who attempted to seek the Timori out for wisdom were also unlikely to survive such a quest if the Timori remained concentrated in one place. After much debate, a solution was agreed to; the Timori must become immortal. Only by avoiding the gaze of death did they have any chance at replenishing their numbers and continuing their battles. The search for immortality was not a new idea for any mage community. Immortality was, indeed, one of the reasons the mages of Atlantis stormed the Supernal Realms. Abandoning, for now, their war against other mages, the Timori began to research how they could achieve their goal. Years stretched into decades as the Timori continued on their quest. The members of the cabal were growing older and older, and soon it turned into a race to see whether they could succeed in their task before they vanished from the Earth. Finally, the Timori discovered that the secret to immortality lay at the very core what makes a mage. They discovered that by ritually devouring Mana and Gnosis from a living host they could infuse their Patterns with enough raw magical energy to stop or even turn back the clock. This solution delighted the Timori. It furthered their fight against mages and also ensured that if they were ever successful in completely eliminating magic from the world that, they, too, would then die. Newly empowered by their discovery, the Timori split their forces to ensure a large enough supply of Gnosis for each of them to survive and went back to war. By the time the Feared began to prey on the fledgling magical communities, the Exiles believed the Feared to be long dead. The Exiles now blamed mage slayings on a group the Exiles called Banishers. Puzzled by this, the Timori investigated the Exiles’ claims and discovered that the old order of peaceful naturalists had given way after the sundering. Those who might once have become like the Locust-Eater seemed driven by an almost instinctual fear and hatred of magic. The word Timori was now used exclusively to describe these new killers of mages, and the true Timori saw the advantage in maintaining in this belief. Since the rest of the Awakened believed the more organized factions to be dead, the Timori hid themselves from view. They worked from the shadows, using Banishers as pawns, to divide mages from their cabals where they were more easily captured and their Gnosis harvested. Such is the history claimed by those Timori who call themselves Feared. They allow other Banishers to cause an uproar, prodding and herding them in the proper directions, then swoop in to collect their prey. Every once in a while, a Banisher Awakens with more than the usual instinctive hatred of magic, and the Timori keep their eyes open for those rare individuals to train as apprentices. Though their numbers are still small compared to order mages, the number of Timori grows more often than it shrinks, setting the stage for the time when the Feared are ready to emerge from hiding and declare open war on the Awakened once more."

They frequently employ spells such as Transform Aura as part of their camouflage and tend to frequent places with large crowds where it is easier to hide their true nature among the throngs. Even when viewed with Mage Sight, the Timori don’t look any more unusual than any other mage. Only when the Timori begin to age due to lack of feeding do they begin to reveal their true nature. Viewed under these conditions, with the Life spell “Pulse of the Living World,” the life forces of the Feared seem sluggish, comparable to an animal that has just awoken from hibernation. The Feared don’t use the word lich to describe themselves and take offense at any comparison to the Tremere liches. The Feared are, however, pleased by the existence of Tremere liches.

		"AttainmentDescription" : "Thanks to the theft of Mana and Gnosis from the living bodies of other mages, the Timori are able to extend their lifespans. Nothing comes without a price, however, and the Timori suffer from a couple of ailments as a result of meddling with their Patterns. Because their bodies are more like preserved corpses than normal, healthy bodies, the Timori have effectively removed their bodies from the Life Arcanum. As they saturate their Patterns with raw infusions of magical power, their bodies begin to crystallize. The result of the crystallization is that the Timori cannot be affected by any Life spell that changes their Patterns in a significant manner. Any attempt to transfigure, hone, heal or wound the Timori, as the result of a Life spell, automatically fails. The other condition suffered by all Timori is addiction. From the first time a Timori tastes Mana that has been harvested from a living host, he longs to relive the experience. No high, not that of drugs or sex, can compare with the sensation of stolen Mana. The addiction only worsens when the Timori first tastes Gnosis. Mana addiction is only a mental addiction, but addiction to Gnosis is a true mind and body addiction. All Timori gain the Flaw: Addiction (see theWorld of Darkness Rulebook, p. 218) from the moment they use their Quintessal Harvest Attainment. This Flaw may never be overcome regardless of how long a Timori goes without consuming Mana or Gnosis. Use of Timori Attainments damages the minds and bodies of the mages the Timori target. A mage may only be subjected to an Attainment, or any combination of Attainments, a number of times equal to his Stamina + Gnosis. Once this total has been exceeded, the mage becomes a shattered wreck that is of no further value to the Timori and is disposed of. Mages who have been so thoroughly violated in this manner (who manage to escape t heir tor mentor s) are broken people. A very small percentage of these pitiful figures may eventually be able to recover from their ordeal, but most simply go insane and frequently end their own lives.

The master passes much of this knowledge on to an apprentice, but there are some things that a student must simply understand. If such understanding is beyond them, the Timori long ago discovered a method of gathering information from their foes. Apprentices often require years of training and study to reach the point at which they can use this Attainment. Once they have mastered it, however, they have nearly completed their apprenticeship. Even when an apprentice has become a master, he still find this Attainment to be useful in the imprisonment of order mages.

Activating the Attainment costs a point of Willpower. The Timori then enters into a battle of wills with her target in an extended contested action. The player rolls Resolve + Intimidation + Mind versus the target’s Resolve + Subterfuge + Gnosis. Each roll represents five minutes, and the first mage to reach 20 successes is declared the winner.

If the target, for example, won by a total of five successes, the Timori would be unable to use Plundered Lore to affect that mage for five days.

Although this Attainment doesn’t provide true power over natural aging, it does slow the process considerably. The Timori reaches into the Pattern of a mage and extracts by force the Mana stored in her Pattern, similar to the function of the spell “Siphon Mana” (see p. 231 of Mage: The Awakening). Activating the Attainment requires the Timori to spend one Mana. The player then rolls Resolve + Intimidation + Prime – the Stamina and Gnosis of the target. If successful, the Timori steals Mana from his target equal to the number of successes rolled. The Timori may not gain more Mana than the target has in her pool. Timori mages may not “steal” Mana from their own pools. Rather than just adding the pilfered Mana to his own pool, the Timori weaves it directly into his Pattern. The Timori may store up to twice their maximum Mana pool in stolen Mana in their Patterns, but if the Mana isn’t used immediately, it bleeds out of their Patterns at a rate of one Mana per day. The Timori can spend stored Mana at a rate per turn equal to their Gnosis rating (with Gnosis 5, the Timori can spend five stored Mana per turn). Stored Mana may be used for one of the following effects: — The Timor i may reinforce t heir Patterns with Mana to resist the effects of aging. The Timori age one day for every week that passes for each point of Mana used in this way. — Because their bodies are so heavily fortified with magic, the Timori may spend stored Mana to heal themselves. The Timori may spend one Mana to heal one point of bashing damage, two stored Mana to heal one point of lethal damage or five stored Mana to heal one point of aggravated damage. Spending stored Mana to heal is considered a reflexive action. — If a Timori manages to completely saturate his Pattern (i.e., reach his maximum allowance) with Mana, he may choose to convert all of the stored Mana in one fell swoop to increase his magical prowess. For each five Mana spent in this way, the Timori gains one Arcane Experience point. Use of stored Mana in this fashion ignores the normal restrictions for how much stored Mana may be spent per turn. Many Timori will feed captured mages regular sources of Mana so the Timori can prolong the pleasure of Quintessal Harvest for as long as possible. Mages that attempt to thwart the Timori by wasting their Mana are severely punished for their defiance, often by the torture and deaths of friends or loved ones.

Rather than the petty theft of Mana, this Attainment targets the very center of a mage, their Gnosis. With mastery of this Attainment , the Timori finally discover the secret to true immunity from aging. Activating this Attainment requires the Timori to spend one point of stored Mana (see above). The Feared then enters into an extended contested action with his victim. The player rolls Resolve + Occult + Prime versus the target’s Resolve + Stamina + Gnosis. Each roll represents five minutes, and the first mage to gain 20 successes is the winner. If the target wins the contest, the Timori may never attempt to drain that particular mage of her Gnosis again. The target has proved herself the master of her mystical soul. If the Timori wins the contest, he drains the target mage of one Gnosis. Drained Gnosis must be spent immediately for one of the following effects: — The Timori may add the drained Gnosis to his own Gnosis rating, artificially enhancing his Gnosis for the next 24 hours. After the 24 hours is up, the Gnosis rating of the Timori returns to its usual rating, and the extra Gnosis dissipates. — The Timori can infuse his Pattern with the stolen Gnosis to halt the aging process. If the Timori chooses this option, he spends the dot of Gnosis and rolls Stamina + Occult. With a single success, the Timori has managed to process the Gnosis and ceases to age for one year. Multiple uses of this aspect of the Attainment don’t provide additional benefits. A Timori may only ever dodge death for one year at a time. — The Timori can use the captured Gnosis to reduce his apparent age for a short time. The Timori spends the dot of Gnosis and rolls Resolve + Medicine. For each success gained on the roll, the Timori can choose to reduce his apparent age by up to 10 years. This effect lasts for one week, after which the Timori swiftly ages, in the span of a few hours, back to his usual appearance. A mage who has been completely drained of her Gnosis returns to Sleep and retains only partial dream-like memories of her life as a mage. It might be possible for the new Sleeper to re-Awaken, but the Timori have no record of this ever happening. Use of this Attainment is considered an act of hubris and requires a degeneration roll for mages of Wisdom 2 or higher (roll two dice)."

				"Text" : "In the Dark Ages, when mages held more sway in the world and the orders waxed in power, great resources were spent in plumbing the most profound secrets of the earth. Sanctums swelled with students, vast libraries of lore were gathered, and expeditions were mounted to the most remote extremities of the globe. Mages journeyed to mist-shrouded mountaintops in legendary lands, deserted isles in uncharted latitudes, lost cities crumbling beneath waves of water, sand or jungle, and into the moldy vaults of rumor-haunted necropolises of antiquity. Some of those who pursued this last course dug too deep into the past and literally awoke the dead. Even the most finely honed Awakened would be sorely pressed to resist the chilling intensity of an undying desire that has festered in darkness and hunger for centuries. These mages found that they had, willingly or not, taken on new instructors, keepers of profound knowledge and wielders of terrifying power, teachers who might have been human once, but were no longer. Masters with a particularly insatiable need. Vampirism is a state of being that comes with fantastic potential, but it is nonetheless a curse. Young vampires do not always grasp the full import of this simple fact, but as the sunless decades of hunger pass, they learn that undying existence is not the same as eternal life. Raging against this fate, an obscure line of vampires called the Tremere encountered an entity from the Abyss and wrested from it certain secrets about the Supernal and Fallen Worlds. Using this forbidden knowledge, they formulated in their blood a way of circumventing their curse by stealing from the living the inner light that they themselves lacked. Through the drinking of blood, a Tremere could tap a victim’s soul, allowing him to live for a short time as if he were nearly human, walking in twilight (but not full daylight) and becoming sated by normal food rather than blood. The process desiccated the stolen soul, however, leaving its owner to wither away into a slow, witless death. The souls of normal humans proved too dim and murky to sustain the Tremere for more than a few days at best. The undead needed something much brighter and clearer. They found what they needed in the Awakened souls of the mages who intruded into their lair, but the very brilliance they desired also ensured that their intended victims were not mere cattle to be seized and consumed with impunity. The mages had to be lured into the fold with intimations of ancient power and arcane lore. The vampires made good on their temptations, unveiling some of the deepest mysteries of vampiric lore. The mages eagerly took the bait, heedless of the cost that would be exacted from them. In tapping the mages’souls while they drank of their blood, the vampires discovered that their Abyssal lore had failed them. The blood burned in their veins with celestial fire and rendered their bodies to ash in mere moments, destroying every single one of them. But their damnation did not end with them. They passed on a part of their curse to their vessels, infecting the mages with the most virulent aspect of their unique Abyssal damnation. The mages, though not undead, had placed one foot firmly on the far side of the grave and found their souls eroding away into the great darkness beyond all light. The spiritual vacuum thus created eventually spread to their outward forms, consuming their bodies until some of them ceased to exist, or else wandered the earth as hungry ghosts. To fill their growing void, the survivors learned to steal the light from those who had it. They had become living vampires, stealers of souls. At first, these sorcerers took the vampires’name, Tremere, as a title to describe their condition: “Tremere-inflicted.”Other mages just called them the Tremere, and over time the lichs accepted this shorthand for themselves, although it is still used as an adjective: “Tremere lich.” A mage must be voluntarily initiated into this Legacy by having his own soul severed by his teacher and replaced with someone else’s. The soul link between instructor and pupil transmits the lich curse once the new soul is attached. Usually, the master then attaches the pupil’s soul to himself, for Awakened souls last much longer than Sleeping souls. It is extremely rare for a young or even middle-aged mage to make this hideous choice. Usually, only those near the end of their natural life spans choose to become lichs in hopes that, by unnaturally extending their lives on a diet of souls, they might unlock the key to ascension and rise to the deathless lands of the Supernal World. And yet, it is possible for a pupil to reverse course and restore his humanity before he has gone too far. If he can regain his own soul and reattach it (using spells, not Tremere attainments) before he raises his Gnosis above the amount of dots he had when he was first initiated into this Legacy, and then if he sacrifices a dot of Willpower, he loses all Tremere attainments and become fully ensouled again. He cannot, however, learn any other Legacy ever again. He cannot engage in soulcraft with a Tremere-touched soul, even though he has overcome the Legacy’s curse. Some have wondered if the vampiric bloodline that damned the mages to lichdom still survives. Although the Tremere mages have searched for any signs of it, they have found none."

		"Notes" : "The length of time a stolen soul preserves a lich depends on the lich’s age. [[MtAw_Legacy_TremereLich_SoulNourishment]] Once a soul begins to erode, a Tremere loses one Willpower dotper week until his will is gone. With each lost dot, the Tremere’s body takes on increasingly morbid features, becoming necrotic until he resembles a rotting corpse or mummy (although his traits are not affected). Once he has no more Willpower dots, he can no longer regain Willpower points (through a Virtue, Vice or any other means), and he then begins to suffer one aggravated Health wound per week. He cannot heal this damage naturally, and it is Resistant, meaning it cannot be healed supernaturally (see “Resistant Damage,” p. 124). Unless he gets a new soul before he runs out of Health, he perishes completely, with no trace or remnant of his identity left in the Tapestry. Only replacing an eroding soul with a fresh soul stops the decline, and the damage begins to heal naturally. Once the Tremere’s Health is restored, he then begins regaining Willpower dots at a rate of one per week. A mage’s soul is far more valuable than any mere mortal’s. Each Awakened soul can actually reduce a Tremere’s chronological age by one stage on the chart above. Thus, a 100-year-old Tremere requires a human soul each month, but if he can steal the soul of another mage (other than a Tremere), he can go six months without a fresh sacrifice."

				"Title" : "Introduction",
				"Text" : "Since the dawn of civilization, mankind has dreamed of creating wealth from worthless matter. Such a dream can be made real, mankind found, but only through hard work and a bit of luck. A lump of stone or wood can, through carving, grinding or knapping, be made into an object that is useful, beautiful or both. Patience and toil can be applied to a patch of dirt to cause crops to spring up or livestock to increase and grow strong. Those willing to sacrifice their time and effort in this way often seem to feel that basing their lifestyle on such activity yields not only material wealth but also endows the soul with extended qualities of utility and beauty. Not everyone was willing to put forth such effort, though, so some devised shortcuts to wealth, claiming credit for the work of others or even claiming the product of that work for themselves. They divorced the notion of “wealth”from the material benefits of work, reducing riches to a system of artificial value placed upon rare metals or gems (and later to printed scraps of paper and then to glowing numbers on a monitor screen). The actual work of enriching life was denigrated as a lowly occupation and the soulcraft it engendered dismissed as fantasy by those unwilling to engage in it. Getting something for nothing only leaves one wanting more. Empty wealth, like food without nutrients, can be addictive, expanding the vacuum it was intended to fulfill. Into such a vacuous society there inevitably resurfaced distorted legends that told of how the mages of old learned the secret of tuning lead into gold, dirt into money, shit into Shinola. With the legends came charlatans, those who claimed to know the trick of getting something for nothing, who were sought out by kings with vacuous coffers, who fleeced their patrons by wrapping their lead ingots in polished brass foil and slipped out of the palace by night with their own empty wealth jingling in their purses. So the legends fell into disrepute (but without ever disappearing entirely) while the quest for empty wealth continued. The truth behind those legends would shock the royal addicts who heard them. Indeed, the mages of Atlantis had learned the “trick”of transmuting one substance into another, but it was only an incidental side effect of their real work. Their labors were not ultimately directed toward the external material world, but inward. Like land, wood or stone, the human soul can be cultivated and shaped, they found, transformed into something both greater and finer than what it might otherwise be. The “lead”that they operated upon was themselves, and the “gold”that they created was themselves. This is not to say that their “alchemy”was a purely contemplative practice, a type of meditation cloaked in a physical metaphor. The image of the secluded chamber with its kiln and clutter of alembic, retort and crucible is factually accurate. Experimentation in the material plane was as much a part of their practice as spiritual discipline. Engaging in a physical craft with an appropriate mindset of self-observation can synchronize changes in both the inner and outer worlds. This Legacy teaches that true understanding is best reached by mirroring the inner process with the outer. Just as matter can be shaped by heat and cold, by hammer’s blow and chisel’s cut, so too can the soul be shaped by pleasure and pain, by feeling and thought. Emotional baggage or faulty modes of thought can be trimmed away and desirable qualities such as honesty and compassion may be added to the alloy mixture in the crucible of the soul. Imperfection can be burned off, boiled out or frozen and chipped away. The soul’s purest essence may be distilled out of the woes and trauma that weigh it down, leaving it free to become that which is rarer and more precious than gold — the fulfilling life of the complete person. Inheritors of this Legacy are known as the “Uncrowned Kings,”a term that most outsiders take to refer to the age of the charlatans, when the rulers of the world could be led by their vacuous desires and anyone who knew those desires could easily become a true “power behind the throne.”But a more esoteric meaning is hidden in the name. Having perfected the technique of crafting their own souls, the Uncrowned could truly claim to be “self-made men,”masters of their own souls. Their “royalty”is based, not upon primogeniture or the hoarding of hollow wealth, but upon the noble qualities that they have cultivated within themselves. They do not rule over nations, but over themselves to a degree that “common”folk can scarcely imagine. The qualifier “Uncrowned”is equally significant on an esoteric level, beyond the fact that they do not openly display their unique nobility. The adornment of precious metals and gems is at once a metaphoric image connoting inner nobility and personal power, a reference to the physical transmutations that this Legacy practices. The title is also an oblique suggestion of the halo found in religious iconography denoting a brilliance or radiance of consciousness so bright that it shines directly through the skull (normally visible to those with aura perception but sometimes accessible to Sleepers in a religious context). But these Kings are emphatically Uncrowned, eschewing not only the lauds of their peers, but also the empty wealth that they are capable of creating."

Intelligence + Crafts is rolled, and the time per roll is at least half an hour, but it can be longer depending on the craft involved. If a month passes without him purifying his soul through the meditative process of labor, he loses his attainments until he succeeds in his calling. Whenever a mage uses the 2nd or 3rd Uncrowned attainment, his head is wreathed in a shining halo, the sign of his alchemically purified soul.

				"Text" : "In seeking to grasp the higher order of the Supernal World, many mages look beyond the artificial reality constructed and maintained by mankind, toward the world of nature. While others leaf through dusty tomes or gaze into the smooth, polished surfaces of mirrors or glass balls in their secluded sanctums, there are those willing to step outside and draw knowledge and power from a greater world not of their own making. They read their incantations and prophecies in the stir of branches in the wind and the fall of leaves. They draw power and strength from the green, growing world. There is a secret language in nature, and from those who are able to read it nothing in the Fallen World may be hidden, for all things are interconnected and everything is reflected in everything else. Nature displays its treasures for all to see, but unfolds in ways that few can ever fully comprehend, changeless only in its ever-changing evolutions, devolutions and revolutions. The diligent mage may divine the intricate syntax and grandiose grammar of this secret language, glimpsing even deeper secrets in the Mists that enshroud mysteries beyond mortal comprehension. Most would halt or turn back, but some press on into this nature beyond nature, this “supernature,”if you will. In the Mists can be found the implicit order from which the visible world grows, the sleeping giants whose bodies are the land, whose breath is the wind, of whose voices the thunder is but an echo. Here is where the faces of nymphs shine through flower and fruit and leaf, where the dances of sylphs trace breeze and gale, where gnomes churn away at the molten heart of the mountain. This is where magic is born, and even the mightiest mage must tread carefully or not at all. The Walker in Mistsreaches beyond the seen into the unseen, tapping magic at the source of all life as was done in times long forgot. Other mages look within themselves, or up at distant heavens, but the Walker actually travels in the world seeking realms of pure enchantment. He knows the deep caverns of the earth where dragons yet sleep, and what ancient invisible roads lead to the fae countries. It was the Walker in Mists who first taught mankind to mark the trails it followed and to recognize landmarks that could lead unerringly from region to region. Rather than following seasonal growth or available game, mankind could choose its own path to its destiny. In short, he taught us not simply to migrate, but to actually travel. To the more settled folk he gave games of chance —the vagaries of which teach, in miniature, the mysteries of fate and destiny —that they too might experience the adventure of the unknown. But with the spread of civilization, mankind forgot the wisdom of the Walker, taking his gifts for granted and detaching itself from the rhythms and cycles of the natural world. Even his games of chance — once used to divine the very will of the gods themselves —degenerated into a competitive orgy of materialistic greed, attracting crime and corruption. As broad, well-traveled roads carved up the wilderness and creased the face of the earth, the Walker found it increasingly necessary to rely upon ley lines to guide him invisibly through the Mists from grove to lake to mountain as he visited the few remaining sacred sites. In modern times, he is completely marginalized, a loner patrolling the fringes of the overdeveloped world."

				"Title" : "Appearance",
				"Text" : "While Walkers seem to occupy the extremes of the physiognomic spectrum, most tend toward lean physiques, better suited for constant travel, and often have tanned skin from the time spent outdoors (although, oddly, with generally smooth complexions). Most favor simple functional clothing when on the road, but all invariably seem to exhibit some natural flamboyance, howsoever understated, that usually blends bohemian and hippie fashions with styles from older historical periods: headbands and armbands, sashes instead of belts, robes or kilts instead of trousers. "
			}, {
				"Title" : "Background",
				"Text" : "Inheritors of the Walking Legacy may emerge from nearly any socioeconomic demographic, although the super-rich seldom manage to take on the risks of this lifestyle. Those who travel frequently out of necessity or vocation are more likely to encounter a Walker, while those of an imaginative or artistic bent are more likely to appreciate a Walker’s enchantments and seek to learn about the wonders he conjures. The subculture of gambling has provided fertile ground for this Legacy, but all Walkers unanimously abhor the commercialism that has degraded their once-sacred pastime."
			}, {
				"Title" : "Organization",
				"Text" : "Every Walker in the Mists is accustomed to the life of the solitary nomad. Although all destinies are shared, all paths leading to destiny are separate. Even teacher and student must part ways eventually. The crossing of paths, therefore, is a momentous occasion inaugurated by lengthy introductions recounting each Walker’s origins and travels, followed by a kind of singing-game in which each takes turns reciting his tutorial lineage until a common spiritual ancestor is found. After that, any food, provisions or contraband carried by each is pooled and shared. Then there may be a general discussion of the omens and portents of the current age, followed by another singing-game in which travel itineraries are compared so that warnings can be given about possible past and future destinations, with particular emphasis on immediate dangers. (This exchange is in accordance with the old bardic line, “When two meet, each is about to go where the other has just been.”) In times of impending crisis or necessary haste, all but the final phase of the ceremony may be dispensed with until some later date when convenience allows. The crossing of paths is rare, and even rarer when paths intertwine so that bands of Walkers take to the Mists. Walker groups, notoriously short-lived, are the stuff of legend, unheard of in the modern day. Rumors sometimes circulate of Walker families who tend to the world’s dwindling virgin wildernesses and sacred sites. "

		"AttainmentDescription" : "To truly walk the Mists, the mage who learns this Legacy needs to be proficient in the Mysteries of Life and Space. These attainments work best in natural environments or in places of ancient power. Since most Walkers come from the Acanthus Path, they are also expected to know the Mysteries of Fate and chance, although these aren’t required for their attainments.",

				"Description" : "The mage peers into the Mists, the continuum of Nature that lies hidden behind the mundane world, hidden even from the Mage Sight. Doing so allows him to scry into distant places as if he were using the “Scrying”spell, p. 235. He must scry through the medium of plant life — trees, flowers, bushes or even grass. As long as there is some form of plant tor is found. After that, any food, provisions or contraband carried by each is pooled and shared. Then there may be a general discussion of the omens and portents of the current age, followed by another singing-game in which travel itineraries are compared so that warnings can be given about possible past and future destinations, with life in the place he wishes to scry, the mage can see there. To peer into the Mists and spy the desired location (i.e., to open a scrying window), an instant action is performed and Wits + Survival + Space is rolled, modified by the sympathetic distance (see pp. 114-115). After he has established the window, a reflexive action is required to view through it. Optional Arcanum:Time 2 If the mage also has Time 2, he can peer into the past at the location he is scrying, similar to the “Postcognition”spell, p. 260. He literally speaks to plants to get their memory of events viewed. He can view the past only if the plants currently present at the location were there during the time the mage wishes to view. "

				"Description" : "By cloaking himself (and others if desired) in the Mists, the mage can create a ward with a Ban of his choice (as long as he has the necessary Arcana knowledge), similar to the “Ward”(p. 236) and “Ban”(p. 237) spells. He can do this only amidst nature, where at least one green shoot grows from the earth. One Willpower point must be spent to summon the Mists if green space is lacking. To create the ward/Ban, he performs an instant action (no roll required) and affects an area based on his Space dots. <table class='jhInline' style='border:1px solid;'><tr><th>Radius or</th><th>Unique Area</th><th>Space Dots</th></tr> <tr><td>4-yard radius</td><td>20 sq. yards</td><td>•••</td></tr> <tr><td>8-yard radius</td><td>40 sq. yards</td><td>••••</td></tr> <tr><td>16-yard radius</td><td>80 sq. yards</td><td>•••••</td></tr></table> If he has Space 4, you can resort to the advanced areaaffecting chart (see p. 118), using dots instead of dice penalties. Optional Arcanum:Time 3 If the mage also has Time 3, he can use Peer into the Mists (above) to divine the future, similar to the “Divination”spell (p. 263). The mage performs an instant action and can ask one question about the target’s future per Time dot. The Mists can sometimes reveal the weave of Creation before it’s made manifest. This power can be used in regard to the same target only once every 24 hours."

				"Description" : "The mage steps into the Mists, traveling wherever he desires as if he had created a Space portal. This ability is like the “Portal”spell, p. 238, although it is an instant action. The effect’s duration, however, is only for the turn in which it is activated and the subsequent turn (in which the mage and/ or his friends presumably step onto the Mist path and step out at their destination). To keep it open longer, the mage must concentrate (as with any concentration-based spell; see p. 119). He can only open a path at and travel to a place with some form of plant life (even a small patch of grass is acceptable). Others can join him on his journey through the Mists: One person of Size 5 or less can pass through the portal per turn; larger people can spend two turns squeezing through. An instant action is performed to activate this power, and Composure + Survival + Space is rolled to determine success (modified by the sympathetic distance of the destination). Optional Arcanum:Time 4 If the mage also has Time 4, he can read prophecies from within his Mist Haven (above), similar to the “Prophecy” spell (p. 264). He performs an instant action and can ask one question about a subject’s possible future (what mighthappen rather than what will happen) per Time dot. This power can be used concerning the same target only once every 24 hours."
